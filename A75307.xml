            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>ſtors: Inſomuch that no barbariſm was left unacted, which could poſſibly be ſupplyed by Zeal and Fury. Now it is beyond all doubt, that both the one and the other of theſe Parties were impelled to ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties onely by a ſtrong perſwaſion, that the Doctrine which they reſpectiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly contended for, was the true and ſole mean to arrive at that Happineſs whereunto we all aſpire. For there is no appearance, that men compoſed of fleſh and blood, and framed (as may ſeem) by Nature to Gentleneſs, ſhould either have expoſed themſelves to ſo many miſchiefs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon a confidence that the matter, for which they ſuffered them, was worthy to be maintained at the expence of all that is deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the world; or given themſelves over
<pb facs="tcp:119039:4"/> to the execution of ſuch ſeverities againſt their fellow-creatures and compatriots, had they not conceived that the Zeal of Religion ought ſometimes to extinguiſh all the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of humanity it ſelf. And in truth, the conſcience being the moſt exquiſitely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible part of man, there is nothing more powerful then it to excite more vehement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, and even more turbulent paſſions in his minde.</p>
            <p>Since thoſe days, there is riſen a third ſort of people, who imagine they have diſcovered a middle way between theſe two, ſecure (they ſay) to avoid falling both into the calamities, whereinto headineſs and inconſiderate zeal precipitated the one ſide, and into thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanities to which an immoderate affection towards an ancient Religion induced the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Expedient is this: That it is meet for a man to accommodate himſelf to that manner of ſerving God, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by cuſtome or authoriſed by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, every one in his reſpective Country, without much ſolicitouſneſs and enquiry whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh, Pagan</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan;</hi> And moreover to fortifie this new Doctrine, they have provided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elves of certain reaſons, to the end that in
<pb facs="tcp:119039:5"/> a matter of ſuch importance they might not be accuſed of departing raſhly from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon judgements of other men. It is their opinion, that God is of his own nature ſo good, and the manner of rendring him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and abſolutely ſincere ſervice, without the leaſt blemiſh of error, ſo dubious and unknown, that provided a man venerate him devoutly in his ſoul, and otherwiſe live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and vertuouſly, he does not ſo narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regard our other ſervices, but of his elemency diſpenſes and bears with us if in ſo great a confuſion of Religions we do not diſcern all their deficiencies, or even in caſe we come to underſtand them, we do never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs continue our conformity thereunto, out of tenderneſs to the publike peace and tranquillity: this gentle compliance conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the interior piety of the Heart, and upright comportments of Life, being a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice far more acceptable to the Deity, then that furious Zeal for certain particular. Opinions, which occaſions ſo many troubles and miſeries. This, they determine, is ſufficient, and that we ought to be ſatisfied with the ſame, arreſting our curioſity of more profound diſquiſitions; ſo far ought we to be from imbroiling of States, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:119039:5"/> Commonwealths in combuſtion, and fleſhing our ſelves with ſuch animoſity one upon another, onely for the cauſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>Certainly, if this opinion were true, theſe men would have brought to light an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſo importunately beneficial to Mankind, that ſcarce any elogiums could be excogitated equal to their praiſe. This would be the way to reduce the minds of men to that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py quiet and compoſedneſs which we ſo ted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wiſh they were brought to; it would conciliate mutual amity between ſuch Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as variance in Religion hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and reſtore tranquillity to thoſe States who have been harraſſed by wars and commotions bred on that occaſion; It would reunite Princes to their Subjects, and Subjects to their Princes, whom diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions in matters of Conſcience have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated; and return to our <hi>Europe,</hi> which is more ſhattered with factions, and rent into Sects and different Profeſſions then any Part of the World, the peace and concord which is ſo neceſſary unto it. And my particular ſuffrage, in caſe the verity of their Perſwaſion could be made out, ſhould be one of the forwardeſt to
<pb facs="tcp:119039:6"/> erect even Temples and Altars to them, for being the authors of ſo ineſtimable a Good. But although there may poſſibly be ſome perſons to whom this Indifference is chiefly acceptable out of the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peace, and the deſire all good men ought to have of ſeeing thoſe great wounds cloſed up which Diſcordance of Opinions hath made in the moſt flouriſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; yet my judgement of the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance is this, That how goodly pretext ſo ever it beareth, there was never a more pernicious opinion brought forth into the World, never any that more artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſtifles all true ſentiments of piety, or was more deſtructive of true vertue; and conſequently which ought to be more abhorred of every good Religious conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And ſhould they which maintain it, have conſpired to baniſh out of the Earth all mention of the Name of God, they could not have invented any other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective complot then to imprint this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in our mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Now although this ſort of people do not as yet make ſo numerous a Party as the two other, and hath not hitherto ventured abroad wholly unmasked; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:119039:6"/> it is growing every day, and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Indifference begins to bear a great vogue, and particularly in <hi>France,</hi> inſomuch that a conſiderable number of thoſe Perſons which are eſteemed the moſt poliſhed either by the education of Litterature or of the Court, are become imbued with it, and even ſome, it ſeems, amongſt thoſe which wear the title of Divines incline to favour it; I have judged it my duty, with the good leave of all true Chriſtians, to engage againſt this Error in this Treatiſe; both to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive, if poſſible, ſuch as are already miſlead into it, and to pre-arm others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its poyſon, that they be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled by the bait: Hoping, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the bened ction of God, to whom my purpoſe cannot be unacceptable, I ſhall find as well thoſe who ſtile themſelves Catholicks as they who are termed the Reformed (notwithſtanding the r mutual Controverſies) candid and favourable, the Error which I attaque being equally ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to both.</p>
            <p>There are three kinds of men that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem the exterior profeſſion of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions indifferent. The firſt acknowledge
<pb facs="tcp:119039:7"/> no Providence, and do not admit God to be concerned with humane affairs, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they believe him of a nature ſo excellent in it ſelf, and tranſcendent above all other beings, that for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration alone be deſerves our reverence and devotions: and this was ſometimes th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Religion of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> to which theſe men have given new birth. The ſecond order confeſs a Providence governing the World, but acknowledge no expreſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the the Will of God in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Service: an Opinion held by the greateſt part of the Philoſophers. And thirdly, another ſort, who beſides the inſtruction which may be collected from Providence ruling the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, and the ſtudy of Nature, do aſſent that God hath revealed ſomething particularly concerning himſelf and the manner of ſervice fitting to be rendred to him; yet eſteem not themſelves thereby obl ged to follow a certain and determined Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Form of Religion: a Sect unknown to the Ancients, and born in our own times. Suitably hereunto, I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to diſpute againſt each Order apart, to the end the Diſcourſe may be more
<pb facs="tcp:119039:7"/> amply ſatisfactory, and the ſeries of the contexture more dependent and conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: in which regard I have divided my Work into three Parts; of which the Firſt ſhall ſerve as a ſtep to the Second, and that to the Third; and ſo each of them diſtinctly treat the Queſtion particularly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to it. But if in ſome places the Diſcourſes ſeem to divert a little from the ſubject, which the Lemma's of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters promiſe; beſides that I do it not out of incogitancy, and have my reaſons for it, which perhaps ſhall appear in their duo time; I hope to manage my Digreſſions which ſuch moderation, that reducing the Reader ſpeedily into his way it will not be offenſive to him to have been drawn aſide for a few moments to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things which I have deemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal deſign of my Work, One advertiſement there is I am to give him before hand, That I ſhall take the greater part of my reaſons from the emanations and motions of our own nature, and from conſcience, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating my ſelf into thoſe prolixe diſcourſes, in which the incomparable advantages of the
<pb facs="tcp:119039:8"/> Chriſtian Religion above all others have been ſufficiently demonſtrated by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from other topicks, and from the teſtimonies of the Ancients. For as thoſe excellent perſons that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took it, have outdone all that I am able to attempt, ſo verily I do not believe that in treating with ſuch as are indued with ſome ſenſe of piety, there are any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons preferable to thoſe which are deſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the motions of the ſame; or that towards ſuch as have none at all, any other courſe of argumentation can be very powerful and effective. I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſome writers have conjoyned this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod with their other reaſons; and ſo far is it from me to go about here to detract any thing from their commendation, that on the contrary I wiſh the labors of thoſe great Men were as carefully peruſed, as their peculiar worth and the importance of the matter deſerve. But ſeeing Books, how good ſoever they be, and in whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver language written, have their Time, at the end of which they remain neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the duſt of Cloſets, and almoſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in oblivion; and that on the other
<pb facs="tcp:119039:8"/> ſide this profane humor is immortal, and gathers youth every day, ſprouting and inlarging to the ſhame of our Age; It ought not to be accounted ſtrange, if after others I bring my Endeavors to the rooting of it up, or at leaſt to intercept its future fertility. And poſſibly my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of imploying no other inſtrument then that of argument and reaſon will not be leſs profitable to the greater part, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard all the world is able to uſe it, then the diligence others have had to inrich their Writings with Diſquiſitions of rare and profound erudition, of which the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned onely are capable judges. Beſides, it many times happens, that what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced upon the credit or teſtimonies of Antiquity, hath not much weight in this matter, with the Intelligent. Becauſe if it be aſcribed to God, theſe Indifferents accuſe it to have been forged, by ſuch as were infatuated by affection to Religion: and if the original of it be referred to men, they are ready with a return that in all ages men have deceived themſelves: So that there remains ſcarce any other principle from which to diſpute againſt
<pb facs="tcp:119039:9"/> theſe people then that of Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to which they would not be thought to renounce. The Eternal God, to whoſe glory I undertake this work, guide my Mind and my Hand in the conduct of the ſame.</p>

                  </gap>y have with that Perſon in his moſt capital Opinions. My purpoſe is not to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them in any other odious dreſs then that of the enormous and ill-beſeeming appearance of their Perſwaſions in matter of Religion; and the ſequel of this diſcourſe ſhall manifeſtly enough diſcover, whether or no it hath been with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Juſtice, that this Sect hath in all times been regarded with a ſort of execration, not by popular judgement only, but alſo amongſt the other Philoſophers. Now whereas there is no Nation ſo projectedly Savage, as to be aliens to the belief of exiſtence of ſome Deity, which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ought to adore; no people, who do not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay by ſome kind of performances to expreſs the ſentiments of Devotion and Honor they bear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; it is difficult to imagine there ſhould be any perſons found of minds ſo immenſely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the common conceptions of reaſon, as to be able reſolvedly to deny it. And the reaſon of the difficulty is this. That Notices which are ſo Univerſal, having a neceſſary foundation and firm root in Nature, it muſt needs be that ſuch as ſtifle the ſame in themſelves, have in the firſt place
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119039:14"/> violated and defaced That. Hence it is that I would not formally accuſe them who maintain that the Deity does not intermeddle in the affairs of this lower World, and conceive we ought to venerate the ſame only upon the account of its excellence, although there is not to be attended from it either Puniſhment for Wickedneſs or Compenſation for Virtue; to have abſolutely ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht the knowledge of it from amongſt them, and to make profeſſion of believing there is a God onely to eſcape the infamous title of Atheiſt. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> indeed reproaches <hi>Epicurus</hi> with this artifice, and raiſes the ſuſpicion upon his Followers; which nevertheleſs ſhall not ingage me to believe that the corruption of our Age could poſſibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford birth to ſuch monſters. But howſoever that particular be, certain it is beyond contradiction, that the Opinions of this Philoſopher lead direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Impiety; and that if they who have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them believe the exiſtence of God, tis Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which prevails in them, and which is never conquerable by all the attempts and outrages they imploy to conquer and ſuppreſs her.</p>
               <p>Three things alone inform us there is a God; his Word, the World, and Man; and they teach us in truth, ſo evidently, and repreſent him ſo live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that ſuch eyes muſt be loſtly obtenebrated, which do not perceive him therein. In his Word we meet with wonderful Revelations, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions ratified by Events after divers Ages, and with ſuch Hiſtories as no man knew, or could know; which notwithſtanding, after they came to be diſcovered, the World it ſelf hath conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119039:15"/> to, the mind of man acquieſces in them, and the ſhadows which have remained of them in the Fables of the Pagans do ſerve for even indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable evidence and teſtimony unto them. On the other ſide it contains a doctrine of that excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that no men of howſoever tranſcendent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, could ever have invented the ſame; which is ſo conformable to our Reaſon, that although it be admirably ſublime, there is nothing in it which ſubverts or incounters the ſoberneſs of our judgements; in a word, all the parts of it have ſuch excellent proportion amongſt themſelves, that ſo many different ſpirits which have left it us in writing in ſeveral Ages, could not have carried on ſo unitedly and with ſuch uniformity a deſign of like grandeur, without a guidance other then humane. Above all, there is remarkable in it a marveilous efficacy to comfort a man in his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, after it hath firſt given him to underſtand it, and unvailed his mind from the ignorance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his own calamity; which without doubt are effects, whereof our conſcience inſtructs us we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y in all Ages, is manifeſted to us therein with ſuch clearneſs, that after ſo long experience which we have made of our natural blindneſs, it can be nothing but enormous ſtupidity not to ſee that God reveals himſelf therein, and that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could have ſpoken ſo ſuitably of his nature and of his perfections. In the mean while the <hi>Epicureans</hi> do not receive this Revelation as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from God, nor attribute ſo much to it by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119039:15"/> far as to the Writings of <hi>Plato, Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> If they may be believed, all the Prophets were men of alienated underſtandings, and the Apoſtles vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond circulators, who went about abuſing the greateſt part of the World. So that it is not from theſe men that they have learnt this truth, That there is a God; for if they gave credit to them in this particular, and avouched to hold it from them, why ſhould they diſbelieve them in the reſt? Or how is it credible that ſo great &amp; frontleſs Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as they imagine the Prophets and Apoſtles were, ſhould be the firſt diſcoverers of ſo excellent a truth? Or if they did not firſt diſcover it ſo as to merit the title of its Inventors, and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we hold it from them, whence can it be conjectured they ſhould have drawn it? It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of neceſſity, that if they had it not from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, they attained it by ſtudy and contemplation, either of the World or of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>As to the World, it is eaſie that it could not be made by it ſelf, and conſequently muſt have an Author. The conſtruction of ſo vaſt a fabrick ſpeaks the power of its Architect; and its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In the Harmony of ſuch variety of things, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry qualities, linked one with another, and in the convenient diſpoſure of all the creatures to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency in mutual offices, without which the World could not ſubſiſt, his Goodneſs is preſented viſible, as it were to our eye, and palpable by our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119039:16"/> hand. In the ſhaping of every thing and the apt Symmetry of its parts, appears an Art not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable by us, but even ſuch as we are not capable perfectly to comprehend. The conſervation of the Univerſe, and adminiſtration of all it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, clearly evidences a Providence conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natural cauſes to their effects, and animating them with powers to produce them, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of all evenements of things agreeably to his will, wiſely ordering the moſt caſual and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. And although there are not wanting ſome to complain of his regiment, and to reproach to him oftentimes the proſperity of the Bad, and calamitous eſtate of the Good; yet it does viſibly enough defend and recompence Virtue, and on the contrary avenges Wickedneſs frequently, ſometimes even to the diſplaying of dreadful judgements upon eminent impieties.

There remains the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Man.</p>
               <p>In our ſelves we may in the firſt place obſerve the ſtructure of our Bodies, which are compoſed after ſo fair a Symmetrie, that the moſt excellent entendments are raviſhed and confounded in the ſpeculation; and even the illterate and they which regard it more ſuperficially, cannot but expreſs their aſtoniſhment at the ſame. In effect, were there in them onely the Maſterpiece of our Eyes, and that Activity of our Hands which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us ſo expedite to all ſorts of ſervices, there would be enough to raiſe amazement in us, and direct us to the knowledge of that infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom whereunto we ow our Originals.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119039:17"/> poſſes is derived into our Nature. For it muſt needs be that we have drawn it from without us; ſince by it we ſo far ſurpaſs our ſelves that our Fathers confes themſelves unable to have communicated it to their chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

More ſignally, the Fear which men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally have, when they apprehend the Deity will revenge their miſdoings; and the Hope to find ſupport from it, with which they comfort themſelves as often as ſtraits and neceſſity afflicts them; two Paſſions which are almoſt the ſole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that ordinarily induce men to Religion; theſe diſcover indubitably that there is ſome Power, which makes it ſelf univerſally percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to all, aſwell in puniſhments as in benefits and recompences.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119039:17"/> not otherwiſe ſubſiſt: So we may remark an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible variety in the Myſteries and Religious Ceremonies of divers Nations, accordingly as they have received them from the tradition of their Anceſtors, or reſpectively followed the guidance of their own humors and imaginations in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and continuance of the ſame; but yet they are unanimous in this, That there ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be ſome form of Religion, becauſe the piety of man towards God could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſubſiſt. Now as it is the evidence of the thing it ſelf which obliges the Reaſon of men to judge that they ought to maintain ſome Societies amongſt themſelves; ſo that whoever acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges not the ſame, but denies to follow theſe natural inclinations, ſeems to have put off hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; in like manner it is the evidence of the thing which conſtrains them to acknowledge it requiſite to have ſome ſort of Piety towards God; inſomuch that he that rejects theſe ſuggeſtions of Reaſon, does no leſs then renounce the nature of man. But according to the Doctrine of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> we do not hold our Being from God, and have nothing either to hope or ſear from his Providence. On the contrary, if their ſuffrage be creditable, that Philoſopher, in having deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men from the frights which conſcience gives them in reflecting on impious actions, deſerves incomparable glory, and ſuch as might in ſome ſort equal him and his diſciples to God.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119039:18"/> Indeed we do not deny but there are certain Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities which are ſo evident that the Faculty whoſe office it is to contemplate them and diſcern the true from the falſe, cannot miſtake in the judgement it makes of them; and we know alſo that the humane Intellect has a natural diſpoſition to ſuch acting; whence it proceeds that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have conſented thereunto, and always paſſed a uniform judgement of them. Upon this conſideration, they have been termed <hi>Common Conceptions</hi> by the Ancient Philoſophers, becauſe they were not peculiar to the <hi>Athenians</hi> or <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, Peripateticks</hi> or <hi>Stoicks;</hi> but were received by all that have the uſe of Reaſon. Such is for example, this Propoſition, <hi>The whole is greater then its part:</hi> But others of deeper intelligence have believed that we do not bring them with us every man out of his mothers womb, but that they are produced from objects which have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us occaſions of reaſoning and collecting thoſe general Maximes from ſeveral particular experiences. So that the firſt perſon that divided a thing into two parts, repeating the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partition over and over, and always obſerving that the parts of it were leſs then the whole in its intireneſs; and then coming from theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar obſervations to conſider the nature of the thing in it ſelf, the diſcurſive Faculty ſum'd up that univerſal Theoreme. The original knowledge of which is conſequently deduced from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of objects, which furniſhed the matter to the ratiocination, from whence ſuch concluſions do emerge. Now the <hi>Epirureans</hi> cannot aver that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119039:19"/> they attained the knowledge of the Deity by this means; ſince they maintain that nothing hath preſented them with any ſhadow or footſtep to raiſe their diſcourſe to the Nature of God. For if the knowledge of him be deducible from the contemplation of ſenſible things, it muſt be in the way of mounting to knowledge of the cauſe by the mean of its effects: but according to the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans,</hi> there is no ſuch relation of affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the objects of our ſenſes. How then? Would they aſſert a like correſpondence between the underſtanding of man and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>There is a God,</hi> to cauſe us acquieſce in it forth with without further ratiocination, as there is between the Eye and Corporeal Light, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it aſſoon as it is ſeen? I conceive this is not their opinion, or at leaſt it ought not. For Light carries it's credential in it's natural ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, as all other ſenſible qualities of bodies have ſomething in them to make themſelves perceived, and which Characteriſes them; ſo that to know them there is no need of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> this Enunciation, <hi>There is light in the Sun,</hi> were he capable of underſtanding the words in which it is conceived.</p>
               <p>I know not but ſome of theſe Worthies may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that we hold this verity from tradition of the Ancients, ſeeing they have left us very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, of which we are not at all in doubt: For prudent perſons have always aſcrib'd much to the opinions of their Anceſtors, eſpecially if they were ſuch as atchieved any thing towards the eſtabliſhment and conſervation of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, or made proviſion for containing men in the reſpect due to Religion. The reaſon of which is a perſwaſion that they were more illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated then their Poſterity, either becauſe the world was not ſo invaded with corrupt maners in their time, or for that they were not yet much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Beginning of things. But in caſe this ſhould be urged by them, yet it will be perpetually neceſſary that thoſe Ancients receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this truth from without themſelves, ſince they could not have it from themſelves any more then we. Shall it therefore be likewiſe from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their predeceſſors? If ſo, we ſhall run back to infinity; and whereas all other traditions have neceſſarily had ſome beginning, this will be found to be eternal. Now this is a thing which ha's not ſo much as the appearance of reaſon, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the mouths of them who are oblig'd to confeſs that the World it ſelf had a beginning, being fabricated by the caſual coalition of Atoms. For if the World began to be, there is no aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119039:20"/> by divers generations of men to eternity; but we muſt at length ſubſiſt in the firſt of all, who cannot have had this important truth from himſelf any more then we, but from the revelation of God, who muſt have diſcovered the ſame to him, to the end he might aſcertain his Deſcendants thereof, and leave it to them <hi>in depoſito</hi> to the end of the world. Now in what place was it that God made this revelation, if, as theſe people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, there is not, nor ever was, either in man, the world, or any Oracle whatſoever, any trace or token of the exiſtence of his Being and of his Divine Virtues? And if God had ſo much care at the beginning to reveal this Truth to the firſt of men, to the end they might not lead a life altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſemblable to that of Brutes; why do they deny his Providence, of which this is an effect ſupremely important? Again, If God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Providence ſhould appear in this occaſion, why ſhould he inſtantly after arreſt the actions of it; as if after having let ſcape either conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly or by inadvertency a beam of his Divinity he retir'd himſelf incontinently from before our eyes, and became envelopp'd in darkneſs eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally impenetrable? Laſtly, what will be the certainty or incertainty of this tradition, I will uſe no other proof to ſhew, then ſuch as I ſhall draw from the confeſſion of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It is a tradition as ancient and as conſtant amongſt men in general, That God takes care of the concernments of mankind, as is in the School of <hi>Epicurius</hi> the tradition That there is a God. Moreover, the world, and the occurrences that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119039:20"/> arrive in it every day, preſent the humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding with proofs incomparably more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that there is a Providence which governs us, then this propoſition, <hi>There is a God,</hi> furniſhes us alone with aſſurances of its proper verity. For on what ſide ſoever it be regarded, wholly naked, as I have laid it open, it affords not any means to the mind to cloſe with it for true, and ſettle it ſelf upon it; whereas on all hands we meet with the materials of our reaſonings upon which we ground the belief of a Providence. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Epicurus</hi> and his Diſciples have dar'd to reject flatly the conduct of Providence, without weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either the tradition of their predeceſſors, or the evidences which ſupport the ſame with ſuch apparent firmneſs. What will hinder all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of men from being as inclinable to deny the exiſtence of God, if we have no other aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it then ſo wild and vagous a tradition?</p>
               <p>Let us allow <hi>Epicurus</hi> a little more, and ſuppoſe the caſe that Nature alone hath imbued us with this truth from our birth, without any need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the impreſſion of it by the contemplation of objects we have before our eyes; Yet it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible how certain Idea's of truths, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intellectual, could be ingraved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; preſerve their lineaments in the materialls of which we are framed; beſides that experience teaches all our fathers, that when they gave being to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it was at ſuch time as they leaſt of all thought of theſe Common Conceptions. But grant it poſſible; yet what is it which they underſtand by <hi>Nature?</hi> For if by that word they pretend to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119039:21"/> denote the concourſe of thoſe indiviſible Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, of which their fancy will have the the world compos'd; or rather that Order which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween cauſes purely natural and their effects (however other Philoſophers deſcribe it) ſeeing this kind of nature hath not it ſelf any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe verities, how hath it communicated that to man which it hath not, and whereof it is incapable to receive the leaſt lineaments or ſeeds? It muſt needs be therefore, that it was God who writ them in the Underſtanding of man, either in him that had them firſt, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame to his Deſcendants, which is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unimaginable; or in every individual perſon, from the inſtant of their conception, which would be highly neceſſary. Now if God hath had ſo great care of mankind as not to ſuffer one ſingle perſon to come into the world, in whoſe breaſt he hath not firſt imprinted this divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, how irrational is it to eſteem him negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent both of us and of that which concerns us? And ſeeing he hath taken this care of us at a time wherein we could not render him any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; why ſhould we not hope to obtain new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits from his hand by our gratitude and by our prayers? I conclude therefore, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the pertinacious gainſaying of theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and with whatever artifice they endeavor either to maintain or diſguiſe their ſentiments, they believe not at all the exiſtence of a God; or if they do believe it, they have ſuch perſwaſion from arguments which induce to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his Eſpecial Providence.</p>

We reverence our Kings out of regard to the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of their Dignity, but they govern and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect us, and the peace of the Commonwealth and ſafety of every particular perſon depends on the homage and obedience which is rendred to them.

In like manner who can doubt that the worſhip which the <hi>Epicureans</hi> render to God is extreamly cold and languid, and that they would not bear it patiently if the remembrance of him were exterminated out of the world? Nevertheleſs, being they ſeem deſirous men ſhould believe otherwiſe of them, let us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the inquiry, into the meaſure and rate of that honor they pretend to expreſs towards him according to their Principles. For in regard <hi>Epicurus</hi> once writ a Tract concerning Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Gods (as <hi>Diogenes, Laertius</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> have recorded) he ſeems to have been willing it ſhould be conceived that his intention was not to baniſh Religion from amongſt mankind.</p>

Thirdly, The expreſſing of Thankfulneſs for benefits already received. And laſtly, The embracing and practice of Virtue, in the conduct of life, out of regard and obedience to him. As to the truſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon his goodneſs, the moſt devout Nations have always with good Reaſon eſteemed it a principal part of his honor and of his ſervice. For if there be any thing that can challenge vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the World, it is the power to do good; if any thing love and commendation, it is the will to put that power in uſe. Wherefore, for that whatever is venerable and praiſe-worthy in the inclinations of men, muſt be in a degree infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more eminent in the Deity, as well becauſe of the infinite perfection of his being, as in that he is the ſource from whence all other things derive the perfections they own; of neceſſity theſe two properties are to be found in him; One, that he takes pleaſure to expand himſelf in acts of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards his creatures, and particularly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mankind, in whom his image is reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; The other, that his power to do Good is incapable of circumſcription. Hence it was that the moſt Religious people, as I ſaid above, have accounted that God became offended if men had
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119039:23"/> leſs confidence in him then was ſutable to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that infinite power and eminent goodneſs; and in the Books we receive for ſacred, ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are expreſly praiſed and commended, whoſe minds were repoſed with greateſt aſſurance upon his care, and which remained unſhaken by the aſſault of great diſtreſſes and perplexities.</p>
               <p>Now as to performance of this ſort of ſervice towards God, it is abſolutely renounced by the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> in as much as they recount it amongſt the principal requiſites of the Divine Beatitude, that as he is without all participation of our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, ſo he does not give himſelf the trouble of having any reſentment or ſolicitouſneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. Whereby, under pretext of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the glory of his felicity, they blemiſh the ſplendour of his Goodneſs, in which conſiſts the principal perfection of his Being. It is, moſt certainly, a happy condition to injoy ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of all ſorts of good things, as not to ſtand in need of others, and to be ſufficient to ones ſelf. But it is alſo beyond denial incomparably more honorable to afford to another ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of this happineſs, eſpecially when it is incapable of any diminution, ſaving by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually reſerved and ſolitary injoyment, without communicating to any other perſon. They ought to have aſcribed to ſo perfect a nature at leaſt as much commendation of benignity as <hi>Ennius</hi> gives him that ſhews the way to deviating travellers, or beſtows fire upon his neighbor, or lights his Candle. For ſo are his words recited by <hi>Cicero;</hi>

               <p>For the next particular, Prayer, they are ſo far from allowing it a part of the ſervice of God, that on the contrary they look upon it as a thing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meriting ſcorn or laughter, being either an evidence of poorneſs of ſpirit in the adverſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of fortune, or a token of abject ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſuch as refuſing to take the pains for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding by induſtry and vigilance to their needs, recurre to God for ſupport of their worthleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Certainly if there be any good conſolation to be had in the ſufferance of calamities, it will as ſoon be found among thoſe that follow a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whatever it be, as among thoſe by whom all ſorts are univerſally rejected; and if examples of magnanimity are to be met with, they muſt not be ſought for amongſt ſuch as place the ſupream Good of mankind in corporeal Pleaſure. This opinion is too ſoft and effeminate of it ſelf, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire men with vigorous and maſculine ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the midſt of adverſities. This is not from the School that gave us <hi>Cato's</hi> and <hi>Regulus</hi>'s; but a more likely Seminary of ſuch as <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> and <hi>Heliogabalus.</hi> Whereas on the other ſide, the Doctrine that inſtructs men to addreſs to the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in time of their afflictions, do's not preſcribe them to abandon the ſhip to the incertainty of the tempeſt, and to lay aſide the practice of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119039:24"/> under colour that all is within the care of divine Providence. Not the Chriſtians onely, but likewiſe the Philoſophers themſelves have conſtantly believ'd, that the Providence of God and Prudence of man do very well conſiſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But the <hi>Epicureans</hi> manifeſt that they are not at all indebted to themſelves in point of good opinion, in that being no more then the dream of a ſhadow (as <hi>Pindar</hi> expreſſeth it, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) they nevertheleſs eſteem themſelves ſufficiently foreſighted and intelligent to pourvey and take order for all their neceſſities, without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a ſoveraign power. Is it in them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Hail from fruſtrating the hopes of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt in the deſtruction of their Corn, or to hinder the Inundations of Rivers from ravaging their fields? Can they forecaſt againſt Peſtilences and Mortalities, or ſecure themſelves from the Gout and Stone? So far ſhort is their ability in theſe particulars, that they know not how to warrant themſelves from being ſtrangled by the ſeed of a grape or a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly, if ſuch a contingency ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide them. But this is not the onely Vertue they vaunt of; for another part of their glory is in the invincible firmeneſs of their courage. What ſtrength ſoever Vertue may have attain'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, by ſerving as a handmaid to the pleaſure of the Body, and pourveying all ways and means to foſter the ſame, which it ſeems is the main imployment they aſſign it; yet it can be hardly imagined, that an <hi>Epicurean</hi> ſhould fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the calamities of <hi>Priamus,</hi> or feel the pains of poor <hi>Philoctetes,</hi> without a ſigh or exclamation.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119039:24"/> And that magnificent boaſt, that the Sage of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> would cry out, even in the Bull of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> that he was at eaſe, was never accounted in the cenſure of the truely judicious but for a vain and extravagant Rodomontade. Religion, on the contrary, is purpoſed to ſhew men their vanity, of which experience convinces them; it teaches them to depend abſolutely on Heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by frames them to humility, the Virtue beſt becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mortality; affording them in the mean time a ſupport in God incomparably more firm, and a refuge of greater aſſurance, then all they are ever able to fancy or invent of themſelves.</p>
               <p>Of grateful acknowledgement for the benefits which we injoy as Tenants from the divine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, there is no mention at all among thoſe who eſteem themſelves not obliged to it for the leaſt hair of their heads. For whereas they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the Univerſe was modell'd in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent order we behold it, by the accidentary coag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of infinite little bodies; it muſt needs be conſequent to their opinion, that the firſt men were framed by the tumultuous and turbulent concourſe of thoſe ſmall particles, and that the Architecture of all our members, and the admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vivacity of our Underſtandings, do alſo ow their Original unto the ſame. Verily, theſe men are much to be wondred at, whoſe groſs belief determines the world and man, in the fabrick of whom appears ſo great Art and Wiſdom, to have been made by chance; notwithſtanding they are convinced that of a million of letters huddled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and ſcattered upon the ground, they can
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119039:25"/> never with a thouſand experiments by the ſame chance compoſe the two firſt verſes of the <hi>Aeneis.</hi> What reaſon therefore can they pretend to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their perverſity, in chooſing rather to ow the wonderful Machine of their Eyes, and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which is the Eye of the Soul, to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which ha's none at all, then to God, whom themſelves make profeſſion to acknowledge for a wiſe and intelligent Nature.</p>
               <p>It remains then, to inquire, whether from the exerciſe of Virtue, which is practiced amongſt men, there may, according to the opinion of this Sect, any honor accrue to the Divine nature. We diſpute not at preſent whether they can be vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, or not; although it be difficult to conceive they ſhould hold Virtue in any eſteem, who have none at all of Piety; and what charity they can have towards men, who are void of gratitude for the benefits they receive from God; and laſtly, what diſcrimination they can make between Vice and Virtue, who believe not God ever diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht them one from another by Laws, or that Juſtice and equity have any thing more to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them beſides the authority of Legiſlators, and advantages of State. Our ſearch onely is, whether from the Virtue of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them not deſtitute of all, there redounds any glory to the Divine Nature. If there do, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts either in this that they devote themſelves to render obedience to him; for it is glorious to great perſons to have their inferiors obey them; or in regard it is he that produces whatſoever is good in them; as the commendation of the effect
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119039:25"/> reflects upward to the cauſe; or becauſe, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating him, they repreſent the image of his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in their own; being we cannot praiſe a pourtraict for the excellency of its air and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without intimating as great applauſe of the fair countenance, it repreſents. Now in the firſt place, whereas God hath not manifeſted his will to men in this point, how can they obey it? For where there is neither law nor commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is an eaſie truth there is no place either for tranſgreſſion or obedience. And here it is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to fly to the umbrage of thoſe Proleptical Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which are naturally imprinted in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. For if Nature hath ingraved in the ſoul at their firſt conception, that God commands them to be Virtuous, how is this conſiſtent with their denying that the Supream Being is intereſſed in that which concerns us, ſeeing he hath taken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the moſt important particular of our life, which is to give us rules for the conduct of the ſame agreeably to reaſon? And how could Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of her ſelf deſtitute of all knowledge of Vice and Virtue, endue us with theſe Idea's and common Notices, without the inſtinct of the Deity? Moreover, how is it come to paſs that Nature hath principled them to diſcriminate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Honeſt and Neſarious actions, without inſtructing them at the ſame time, that to theſe latter belongeth Vengeance, and to the other Recompenſe and Praiſe; and that there can be no other then God, from whoſe hands both the one and the other is to be expected. For true it is, the Difference between Vice and Virtue is not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119039:26"/> more naturally known, then it is naturally known that Virtue challengeth ſome Commendation, and that Vice ought to be attended with Blame for its retribution; Commendation and Blame, I ſay, which are but ſleight matters, and of ſmall conſideration, if they be hoped or feared onely from the mouths of Men. Are the Cenſure or Eſtimate we make one of another of equivalency to what <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> have merited by their Villanies and Abominable turpitudes? How are they hurt now, in that their Memories are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous and execrable? And the Applauſe which we give in theſe days to the Virtue of <hi>Regulus,</hi> is it a recompenſe proportionate to the miſeries which he endured for love of his Country? But theſe Opinioniſts manifeſt that 'tis not in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God that they live honeſtly and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if at leaſt there be diſcernable any Tract of Honeſty and Juſtice in their Lives.</p>
               <p>Nor do they more liberally aſcribe to God the glory of their Virtue, as being the Author of the ſame; otherwiſe, they ſhould of conſequence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that they received ſome benefit from him, yea the greateſt of all benefits, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which all the reſt together deſerve not to be called ſuch; a confeſſion which they would not make even upon the Rack. So that it remaines onely, that the Image of God himſelf is relucent in their Virtue. But how will that hold good? Since according to the principles of this ſingular Diſcipline, the Nature of God, how luminous ſoever it be in it ſelf, is ſo abſtruſe from mortals knowledge, that we cannot comprehend the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119039:26"/> leaſt reſemblance of the lineaments of Virtue with its Prototype. We may ſooner come to underſtand what are the properties of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, or the cauſes of the Reciprocation of the Sea, or the moſt unknown influences of the Stars: becauſe it is poſſible at leaſt to diſcover ſomething of them in their effects, and the aſſiduous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation we ſpent upon them would perhaps clear up a little portion of the obſcurities which enwrap them. But God being not revealed to us in any effect, on what rocks ſhall we climbe up into the Heavens to behold him there, or with what inſtrument ſhall we ſound his Abyſſes? Now there is no way to comprehend the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance which is between the Model and its Image, but by having either both before the eyes, or at leaſt a lively Idea of both in the minde. Adde hereunto, that whoſoever ſhould imitate the Deity according to the Maximes of theſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhould never do good to any man: he ſhould never afford ſuccour to the Miſerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God do's not ſuffer himſelf to be moved at their cryes, and cannot admit his Beatitude to be diſquieted by reſentments of compaſſion in ſuch caſes: he ſhould take no care of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, ſince God leaves them at random: he ſhould puniſh no malefactors, being God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nives at their crimes and is not at all offended with their enormities; good men ſhould never find relief and ſupport from his hands, ſeeing God ha's no regard to the oppreſſion that afflicts them; or if he behold the ſame 'tis with neglect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibility: he ſhould enjoy all his pleaſures by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119039:27"/> himſelf, becauſe God do's not communicate his felicity to any other perſon. But in as much as God is eternally happy, and injoys ineffable contentments, it is abſolutely impoſſible they ſhould reſemble him. For who is he in the World that can boaſt himſelf to be happy? and in this brevity of our Life, who is there ſo fooliſh as not to deſpaire of immortality. But in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they can imitate him, if they undertake to do it, they render themſelves the moſt unprofitable men of the Earth, and cannot ſo much as exempt themſelves from the reproof of being vitious and wicked. The nearer they approach to that God whom they deſcribe with ſuch qualifications, the greater infamy will they draw upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; on the other ſide, the further they recede from him, the more recommendation will be due unto them. But I do not conceive, but ſuch perſons in whom is remaining any ſpark; I will not ſay of conſcience and reſpect towards God, but of judgement and common ſenſe, will account this Doctrine yet far more abominable then it is falſe, extravagant and inconſiſtent. Now all the Piety of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> amounts to this, that they adore the Deity out of reſpect to his Virtues, and the excellence of his Nature; which in what manner they can perform, is our next inquiry.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> With what kind of Adoration the <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> according to their Principles can ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate the Deity.</head>
               <p>WE do not gainſay to <hi>Epicurus,</hi> or thoſe which follow his ſteps in our times, but that the Deity in reſpect of the excellency of his Nature is to be adored, although neither the puniſhment for wickedneſs, or the reward of Virtue lay in his hands: ſo far are we from pretending that, that by attributing to him perfections incomparably more excellent then they do, we repreſent him, in himſelf worthy of much greater veneration. Notwithſtanding, we judge, that this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone, if his care and government of humane affairs be renounced, is inſufficient to induce men to render him ſuch honor as is proportionable in any meaſure to what we ow him; for, as to the performance of ſuch as correſpendent to this natural excellence, 'tis a point too high for the utmoſt vigor of our Underſtanding to attain to, however exalted by culture and induſtry. There are three motives which uſe to be moſt prevalent with us, to conceive any eſteem of things; namely, The profit we receive by them, The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we find in them, and Their natural beauty. Now there is no perſon whom experience hath not taught, that this laſt conſideration is the leaſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119039:28"/> powerful of all, and that there is rarely found any affected with it, where at leaſt one of the other two, or both do not accompany it. Hence it comes to paſs, that the number of thoſe is ſmall who devote themſelves to the ſearches of things of no great uſe to humane Life; few that ſtudy thoſe Sciences which lye in Contemplation in compariſon of them which apply themſelves to the Arts which afford ſome fruit or benefit; and even the greateſt part of thoſe ſpeculative Inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers make their Theories ſubſervient to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Sciences, wherewith they ſupport themſelves; as Natural Philoſophy to Medicine, Geometry to Architecture and Peinture, Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to Agriculture and Navigation, and in like manner of the reſt. The Metaphyſicians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, do not willingly ſpend their pains in that Science, which is the chief and moſt eminent of all, and hath for its object the things which moſt deſerve our knowledge, but to the end to teach the ſame, and that onely for the further end of profit which accrues to them by it. Wherefore if it ſhould once come to be imprinted in the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of men, that there is nothing to be expected from the Deity, all thoughts of him would ſoon be worn out of their minds; and there would not be found ſo much as the thouſandth part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that would concern themſelves with any greater care of him, then they do of the valour of <hi>Hector,</hi> or the exploits atchieved by <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Theſeus.</hi> Concerning the ſecond attractive, Pleaſure which hath a very powerful influence over our affections, it is difficult to imagine that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119039:28"/> there is ever ſo little in the knowledge of God, ſuch as <hi>Epicurus</hi> repreſents to us. For all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation which the knowledge of things affords, when there ariſeth no other benefit from them, is in a manner derived from one of theſe two foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; either in that they are worthy to be known becauſe of their natural beauty, as the Heavens with their motions, and the conſtant courſes and revolutions of the Planets; or for that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Truth moſt lively and clearly diſplayed in them, which in what ſubject ſoever it be found, is ſupreamly agreeable to the Mind of man. As for example, One eſteemed it ſo amiable in this propoſition, <hi>That in a right angled Triangle, the ſide which ſubtends the right angle, makes a ſquare equal to the ſquares made of the two ſides containing the ſame,</hi> that in great raviſhment, having been the firſt that found out the demonſtration thereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he could hope no profit from it, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded that he went home and ſacrificed a whole Hecatomb. Now beſides, that to be in a capacity of receiving Delectation from the knowledge of ſuch things as theſe, it is requiſite to be gifted with a quick, piercing, and comprehenſive Wit, and that the number is not great, which Nature hath favourably framed hereunto, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence onely a few perſons will be affected and drawn to the knowledge of <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Deity by that motive; the contentment even of them that imploy themſelves in the ſame cannot be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For, as to the certainty, and aſſuredneſs of ſuch knowledge, I would demand wherein it muſt conſiſt; ſeeing according to their aſſertion,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119039:29"/> all that can be known of God is drawn from I know not what natural vagous and indetermin'd notion, which hath not been of force enough to reſtrain all Nations from aſcribing an innumerable variety of ſhapes to the Deity, this of one ſort, and that of another, not ſeldom repugnant and contradictory. And whereon is the confidence of <hi>Epicurus</hi> grounded, when he boaſts in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the clearneſs of his knowledge in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, whilſt the God which he ſometimes fancied to himſelf is rather a Chimera, or the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of a man in a Phrenzy, then a conception ſuteable to a Philoſopher or deducted from ſober inference of reaſon. <q>The Deity (ſaith he in <hi>Cicero</hi>) hath not a body, but as it were a body: nor blood; but ſomething of neer equivalence to blood.</q> Notwithſtanding, he teaches that this nature, conſiſting neither of body nor ſpirit, and conſequently whereof it is impoſſible for him to frame any rational Idea in his imagination, is ſhaped after the reſemblance of a humane body, becauſe that is of all figures the moſt agreeable and commodious. But if all the Conceptions wherewith <hi>Epicurus</hi> and the other Philoſophers have offered to repreſent the Deity be thus confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d incertain, it is incredible they ſhould yield any ſolid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pleaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo the Adoration which will reſult from thence, cannot be but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſleight, flitting and defective.</p>
               <p>In effect, the firſt conſideration which ought to be made of the nature of God, is to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be finite or infinite in his eſſence; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as infinity of eſſence implyes infinity of all
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119039:29"/> properties and Vertues; and on the other ſide, if the eſſence be limited, it is neceſſary that all facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Virtues which are in God be reduced and proportioned to the meaſure of his extention. And this is abſolutely important to be known, for the rendring unto God the honor which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to him. For if his eſſence be limited, &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if the attributes which are in him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of adoration be likewiſe limited; although they ſhould far ſurpaſs what ever can be vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in our nature, yet it follows, there will be always a proportion between him and us. So that the Adoration of the Deity will be an honor but of the ſame ſpecies with that which we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſome Worthy Perſon, and there will be no difference between the one and the other ſaving of Greater and Leſſer, that is, in regard of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees onely; ſuteably to what we obſerve in lights which proceed from luminous bodies, in which there is this difference, that ſome are more duſky, and others more glittering; which becauſe they agree in this that they are emanations of principles of one and the ſame nature, ſuch as the bodies are, we love them with the ſame ſort of affection, and meaſure that affection by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of clarity or obſcurity we perceive in them. Did I ſay, there would be a proportion between God and us? There would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but we ſhould ſcarce contain our ſelves from believing the advantage to be on our part. For as we eſteem the Light by the knowledge which we have of it, and the benefit which arrives to us by it; ſo that a man, to whom the Sun ſhould be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119039:30"/> eternally abſconded, would make more account of the Moon, or even of a candle that inlighten's him then of that: So they that love Virtue would have greater eſteem for <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> or ſome other grand perſonage, ſuch as they were, upon the account of knowing them, and being able to advantage themſelves in the imitation of them, by taking from them ſome prudent rule or cuſtom for conduct of their Lives, then they would do of the God of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who reſerves himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velop'd in obſcure Clouds, and do's not afford us ſo much as a glimpſe of the leaſt ſplendor of his Nature.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, If God be infinite in his eſſence, and, which neceſſarily follows, in all his Properties, he deſerves an Honor, altogether of another kind from that which is competent to Men. For there being no proportion between a Being Finite and Infinite, there likewiſe can be none between whatever reſults from them. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whoſoever ſhould value a man onely ſo far as he is a Living Creature, without any regard to the Reaſon that infinitely differences him from Brutes, he would do him a greater affront and outrage then could admit of any reparation: and on the other ſide he that ſhould eſteem a beaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the ſame rate that we repute a man in as much as he is indued with reaſon, would attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute a worth to it, to which it is by no right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titl'd, and would brangle the rules of the Nature of things. Therefore he that ſhall aſcribe honor to God after the ſame ſort with that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd towards Men, unqueſtionably ſins againſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119039:30"/> him in caſe he be infinite, and abaſes him infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly below the condition of his Being: whereas, contrarily, if he be of a nature finite and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with certain bounds, to adore him as an eſſence immenſe in himſelf and in his properties, would not be to adore the Deity but a fantaſm of a mans own brain and a Chimaera. And in the imagination of the thing it ſelf, beſides the vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity attending the Adoration which is framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, there would be an error too groſs and inſupportable, whereby that which is finite ſhould become transfigured into that which is not ſo, contrary to the Laws of nature her ſelf, which knows not to allow any thing for Infinite, if God be not.</p>
               <p>Now foraſmuch as the motions of the Body fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe of the ſoul, and repreſent the ſame; if there be, as is evident, a difference ſo great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two ſorts of adoration in reference to the inferiour acts of the Underſtanding; of neceſſary conſequence the Corporeal Geſtures which proceed from the ſame, muſt be extreamly different one from another. So that as the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an infinite thing is an ingulphing of the cogitation in raviſhment and admiration of it's object, conjoyned with as profound humility as the ſoul of man is capable of, without limitation, reſtriction, or reſerve; ſo the exterior comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments appendant to the ſame ought to be ſuch as may moſt expreſs the acknowledgement of our ſelves to be nothing, and our deference of all honor and glory to that which we venerate. But ſince the honor which is render'd to a finite thing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119039:31"/> is exactly confined and determined by our mind, onely to ſo much as it is judged worthy of the ſame, that is, according to the meaſure of its Virtues: humility alſo bounding it ſelf where it deemes the extent of thoſe Virtues to be ſo; it muſt needs be that the Geſtures of the Body like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in repreſenting our ſubmiſſion, will repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that we do not offer it without ſome limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that we eſteem not the thing beyond the value of its being. Hence it is evident that in ſo great an incertainty of the Nature of God, which we ſee according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> a man cannot boaſt to know aſſuredly, it will be conſequent that his Diſciples be brought to render him ſuch honor as is no more competent to him, then that which one ſhould aſſign to a beaſt in reſpect to the excellence of its Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſo mock him with impertinent ſervice: Or rather, in ſtead of adoring him as God, we ſhall honor him as a man; like as if one ſhould make the ſame account of a Grand Perſonage, and a Handſome Horſe: which would be no Worſhip rendred to God, but an outrage done to him and a Sacriledge. Or laſtly, in caſe a man ſhould happen to be in the right, it would onely be by hazard; And with what zeal can that ſervice be accompanied, or how can it be acceptable to God, which is rendred inconſiderately and at a venture?</p>
               <p>The ſecond conſideration requiſite to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended concerning the Nature of God, is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be corporeal, or not; of which they can in no wiſe be aſſured, if they will hold themſelves
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119039:31"/> to their Principles. For if there be nothing in the world that declares him clearly to them, how come they to have ſo raiſed and ſublime a ſpirit, as to be able to divine of what his ſubſtance is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed? But, becauſe heretofore their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in diſputing this Point againſt the other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, found themſelves wonderfully impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, what ſide ſoever they took, they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a kind of illuſion of the World, that it was not a corporeal, but in a manner a corporeal eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And although they aſſever that to injoy the Pleaſures in which the Felicity of the Deity conſiſts, it is neceſſary the ſame ſhould be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with ſome kind of Organes correſpondent to the ſenſes of our Bodies; from whence it ſeems to reſult that they hold it to be really corporeal; yet when they are preſs'd to ſpeak affirmatively, they have not the preſumption to determine it ſo, but recur to thoſe illuſions of words, which place it between Bodies and Spirits, as it were in an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginary Predicament. Now this is of greater conſequence, then they deem it to be. For if God be a ſubſtance that partakes nothing of the nature of Bodies, to poſſeſs our imaginations with an Idea of him of corporeal ſhape, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſoever it be, is, in ſtead of honouring him, to defame his glorious Majeſty; in as much as a Nature abſolutely ſimple and ſpiritual, far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing in dignity the condition of Bodies, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conceives the ſame under the Idea of a body, debaſes it many degrees beneath the worth of its being. Wherefore, if beſides the image they ſo frame of it in their thought, they proceed further
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119039:32"/> to repreſent the ſame in Marble or Copper by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of the hand, what is this leſs then doing the ſame wrong, which ſhould be done to an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Underſtanding in ſaying it reſembled a Gourd. And if he be corporeal, and they do not conceive him ſo, they will fall into the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience I mentioned above, of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not the truth of the thing to which they pretend to render honor, but the dreams of their own fancy.</p>
               <p>To what I have already evinced I ſhall further adjoyn, that it is natural to men, when they think upon any thing, to tranſmit their Minds to the place in which they imagine ſuch thing to be; which is the reaſon, why, although we never were among the <hi>Mores</hi> and <hi>Toupinemboults,</hi> yet we cannot reſtrain our ſelvs, when we ſometimes call them to remembrance, ſrom ſending our thoughts to the places of the Geographical Charts, in which the Regions of their habitations are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. And if a Peaſant happily hear mention of thoſe remote people, he preſently fancies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Fys the Sea that lyes neareſt his habitation, becauſe he ha's underſtood it is neceſſary to paſs over that to arrive at the place of the world where thoſe Savages abide. It is, indeed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all Incongruous or ſtrange, that Nature ſhould have given us ſuch inclinations, becauſe they ſerve in ſome meaſure to recreate and arreſt ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119039:32"/> is nothing before us to arreſt our view. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we are conſcious it is thus in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, yet it is more particularly remarkable when ever we find our ſelves agitated with ſome vehement paſſion of Love and Deſire, Fear or Hope. Now if the <hi>Epicureans</hi> repreſent to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Deity of a finite Nature, whether Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real or Incorporeal it matters not; I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of them to what ſide of him is it that their thoughts guide them? Have they credible intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence where God is? in the Heaven, or in the Air? in the Sea, or in the Center of the Earth? For as for other men, they indeed are perſwaded that he is in the Heavens, becauſe they believe he hath there diſplay'd at the beginning, and doth likewiſe ſtill diſplay more Effects of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power, and inexpreſſible Goodneſs. But the <hi>Epicureans</hi> are perſons that acknowledge no tract or appearance of theſe Attributes, imagining that admirable and glorious Machine of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Fabrick to have been compoſed of ſo many Spheres in the fair order we behold, onely by the accidental meeting of Atomes. But if the Splendor of that Radiant Arche ſeems to them a more ſutable reſidence for the Deity, then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation on the earth or in the receſſes of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elements, who hath informed them in which Hemiſphere he is, whether in ours, or in that of the <hi>Antipodes.</hi> Then if by that chance, to which they aſcribe all things, they ſhould hit ſo luckily, or determine their ſancies to think him on the ſide of our Hemiſphere, will not the <hi>Epicureans</hi> that are on the other ſide of the world be very
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119039:33"/> much miſtaken, if they ſhould likewiſe have this imagination on their part that God reſides in that moiety of Heaven which covers them, and which they behold? Add hereunto that neither the one nor the other can have aſſurance that God ſees them, or that he underſtands their hearts, and eſteems their motions and thoughts acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf. Now is it poſſible that a man that doubts whether God hears and ſees him, ſhould have any rational devotion towards him? In what faſhion can that perſon ſerve God in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of his Thought, that is not aſſured whether God hath Eyes piercing enough to know the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of his Heart? If they conceive God to be of an infinite nature, as in truth he is, ſo that he is preſent to all things, even to their moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and profound meditation, (which without queſtion they never learnt from the diſcipline of their Maſter) there will ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As the infinite comprehenſion of his Wiſdom gives him the underſtanding of all things exempt from ſolicitude and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and as the inviolable purity of his eſſence renders him their preſence, and (if I may ſo ſay) their contact exempt from the contagion of their immundicity; ſo the infiniteneſs of his power frees the government and adminiſtration of them from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119039:33"/> being troubleſome, and the invariable firmitude of his being ſecures him from receiving any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in his Eternal Felicity.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> A more particular conſideration of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which the <hi>Epicureans</hi> pretend to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to God in reſpect of his Power, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Juſtice, and Wiſdom.</head>
               <p>BUt after theſe General reaſons, let us proceed to Survey thoſe which may be drawn from a more particular conſideration of the Properties of the Divine Eſſence, and in the firſt place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what Honor the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Doctrine aſcribes to him in reference to his Power. They who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God to have created All things of Nothing (a poſition indeed which we owe to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from Heaven, yet ſuch as the right ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Man ſubſcribes to) have a very powerful inducement to become abſolutely raviſh'd, and ſwallowed up in admiration of his Omnipotence. For whereas there is a chaſme of infinite extent between Entity and Non-Entity, of neceſſity the Power that ha's produc'd ſome thing from Nothing to Being, muſt be likewiſe infinite. Wherefore in caſe they had no more before their Eyes but this one Proof that God hath given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what He is, they ought to be ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119039:34"/> as to ſeparate him from Parity with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, and render him an honor of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wholly different from that which they exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite to Creatures. For ſeeing the power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are capable to be indued bears no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to that of the Creator, they cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titl'd to the ſame ſort of Honor with him, not ſo much as in the loweſt degree; if it were poſſible to admit degrees in the honor due to an Infinite Being. They which conceive the Matter of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things to be eternal, but that God compoſed the World of the ſame, as a Potter frames his veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of his Clay (which ſeems to have been the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Plato</hi>) do not conſider the Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in ſo eminent a degree; albeit they do indeed attribute an effect to it, which to ſerious perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſeems onely atchievable by an infinite cauſe. For any power below infinite could never have been capable to beſtow ſo excellent a Form upon a Chaos devoid of all, nor to impart the like to all other things which the World contains, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing formes to them, ſo different as they are, according to the divers rank that each holds in the Univerſe, and the various functions to which they are deſigned. So that likewiſe thoſe of this judgement have ample argument and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to proclaim the wonders of it. As for them, who aſſert the world, ſuch at it preſents it ſelf to our eyes, had never any Beginning, but that it proceeded from God by emanation, as Light do's from the Sun, and by a neceſſary and natural production, they do in truth very much detract from the glory of this Virtue, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119039:34"/> they always imply an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Univerſe owes its Original unto him, although that great Effect were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by that Cauſe by the diſpoſure of free Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, but by the neceſſity of an inevitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance. Yet this Order alſo, were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Circumgyration of the Celeſtial Orbes, of which they repute God the firſt cauſe, hath cauſe to admire the force that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite thereunto. For whether God move the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens immediately and by himſelf, without the intervening aſſiſtance of any other thing (as one applies his hand to a wheel to turn it) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any aptitude they may have to circular motion by reaſon of their natural figure, yet there needs a mighty ſtrength to ſtir all that great Machine, and to govern ſo many different revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, to preſerve them in harmony, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from claſhing or interferring for ever. Or whether he moves the ſame by the Mediation of Intelligences, according to the conceit of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> who was father to this Opinion of the Worlds Eternity; nevertheleſs God will always be the firſt Efficient of their motion; and if the Intelligences, which are far inferior to him, can do that, He is without doubt able to do much more. Moreover we know that Philoſopher ſpeaks very advantageouſly of the dignity of the Firſt Mover, &amp; attributes to him the glory of being the primary Principle of all things. But in reference to the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> they want our charity to make up ſo much as a probability that they believe the Supream Being is indued with any power at all.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119039:35"/> For what evidence have they for ſuch a perſwaſion from his effects, if He hath not created the leaſt Muſhrom, nor given impulſion to ſo much as one of thoſe ſmall Bodies, by whoſe concurrence they hold the World had its contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Certainly, if they meaſure this power by the knowledge they have of it, and their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by the effects they behold of it (and it is clear they cannot know it otherwiſe) it muſt needs be extreamly inconſiderable, or rather none at all, in caſe they keep themſelves to their Maximes.</p>
               <p>But peradventure ſome among them will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that being there is a God, it is neceſſary he ſhould poſſeſs all Perfection required to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of ſo excellent a nature, and that among thoſe perfections there ought to be a power alſo proportionate to the excellence of that nature. We will not ſcruple to concede this to them, although we ſhall afterwards ſhew where they learnt to reaſon in this manner: for the diſcipline of their ancient Maſter is of a different ſtrain. However, all this will not ſecure them from falling foul upon the difficulties above-mentioned, of determining the extent of eſtimation which ought to be had of this Attribute: becauſe it will follow that there is ſome meaſure between It and the Eſſence of God. Now it remains abſolutely unknown to us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the eſſence of God be infinite or not, whence conſequently the meaſure of Veneration which we ow him in regard of that Perfection is to us equally unknown. Beſides, whereas the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all things are deſtinated to certain functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119039:35"/> it will be difficult to be reſolv'd what porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of power is neceſſary to render the Divine nature accompliſht, ſince it cannot be underſtood that God either hath, or ever will employ the ſame to the production of any effect. And though it were frankly granted them that right Reaſon informs us, either that there is no Deity, or that it owns a power without circumſcription; Yet I dare maintain, Men would make but ſmall account of that Perfection, which they knew no otherwiſe then by a ſimple ratiocination without having any actual teſtimony or proof of the ſame. Who is he amongſt us that cares never ſo little for the Great Mogul, of whom it is related, that he keeps thirty thouſand Elephants? or for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mighty Potentate like him in thoſe Oriental Countries, becauſe perhaps he is able to bring two or three hundred thouſand armed men into the field when he pleaſes? Do's not every one more value the authority of the meaneſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Country where he lives, if he be Lord of his village; becauſe he ſees it and feels it; and for that in caſe he offend him, it ſerves to puniſh him; and if he obey it, he finds ſupport by it? Theſe people aſſuredly have ſtrange Imaginations, and are made of principles wonderfully diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. Obſerve, I beſeech you, the diſcourſes of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> when he is treating the queſtion of the Supream Good; They are univerſally drawn from the ſentiments of the Body, and from Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to which our appetites naturally encline us. He affirms that Nature do's not onely aſpire but pine and groan after her Eaſe; ſuch is the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119039:36"/> violence of her inclination towards it: He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes his Sage to refer all to his own utility, and the contentment of his Senſes; as if he conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely of Body, and were born for none but himſelf. Doth he ſpeak of the Deity, and of the Honor which ought to be rendred to him? He abſtracts the thoughts of men ſo far from their proper Good; he allows himſelf ſo little to be touched with the natural affection we bear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſelves; he alembicks his wits in ſuch manner in the ſpeculation of things purely intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual &amp; phantaſtical, without having any regard to his particular profit, and his own ſatisfaction, that you would judge he were all Spirit, and had forgotten the care of himſelf and his Nature. But to Character him compleately in one word; he perfectly reſembles that God whom he deſcribes ſo negligent of humane affairs, and ſuch a lover of his own felicity. For as according to his dictates, God contents himſelf with the ſolitary injoyment of his eternal repoſe in delectation, and profound vacancy from action, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf with any care either of us, or of our intereſts; ſo <hi>Epicurus</hi> gives himſelf no other trouble then to ſeek out means how to paſs his days in delights, without anxious perplexing himſelf concerning God or things pertaining to him, and ſo allows himſelf the ſame kindneſs. Yet there is this difference; that <hi>Epicurus</hi> do's not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he offends God in proclaiming openly that he takes no cogniſance of things here below; but dare not plainly aver that he is unco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cern'd with the care of thoſe in Heaven. And neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119039:36"/> it really turns as much to the reproach of the Deity, to leave all to go at random, as it is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to make open profeſſion of Impiety towards him. But let us now proceed to the other Divine Proprieties.</p>
               <p>Although the greateſt part of Mankind hath always been lead to ſerve God by Fear of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which he inflicts on the contemners of his Majeſty; yet there was never any Nation but did acknowledge ſome remarkable Appearances of his Goodneſs in the Government of the Univerſe. The whole world hath ever placed amongſt his moſt reſplendent Perfections this propenſity which he hath naturally to do good, to ſuccour the Diſtreſſed, to relieve the Oppreſſed, to defend ſuch as are injuriouſly outraged, and even where no neceſſity impells or otherwiſe obliges him, to expand himſelf in Liberality, the Quality pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to benigne and generous Natures. Hence have thoſe glorious Titles been attributed to him by men upon this conſideration, as particularly by <hi>Homer,</hi> who ordinarily ſtiles his <hi>Jupiter,</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Gods and Men; not onely in as much as he is the Author of their Being (as another Poet expreſly, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.) but alſo for the care that he hath of them, and the paternal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections he beareth towards them. In effect, the luſtre of his Majeſty dazles them when they liſt up their eyes towards the Heavens, to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate there the umbrage or reverſe part of him that appears in their ſplendor. His Power aſtoniſhes them, when they feel the Earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under their feet, or hear the tumultuous
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119039:37"/> murmurs of Thunder in the clouds. The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Wiſdom confounds them, when they come to conſider that he beholds all things with one glance of his eyes, and one ſimple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible apprehenſion, the Heavens, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Bodies that are compoſed of them, the innumerable variety of their faculties and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the cogitations of our minds, and of all Intellectual Beings, all things which are onely in poſſibility, the Idea's of which are multipliable to infinity, their accordances and relations, their oppoſttions and Antipathies. His Juſtice ſtrikes them with dread, when they Survey the ſtrokes and examples of it in mankind by Peſtilences and Wars, by Famines and Tempeſts, by over-flowes of Rivers and Inundations of the Sea, by light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings diſcharged from Heaven, and other like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of his Vengeance. In a word, all his other Virtues excite either Fear or Wonder in the Spirits of men; but the reflection upon his Goodneſs, and the experience they have of it, is that which rejoyces them, and makes their Lives ſweet and deſirable. As for Chriſtians, they not only admire and venerate the other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God, more then ever any other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did, but likewiſe ſet a higher eſtimate on this then other Nations ever have done, and make it the prime baſis on which their whole profeſſion is ſupported. On the other ſide the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> if they have any knowledge of it, it can be onely in an imaginary ſpeculation, in the ſame manner as we above convinced their conjectures concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Power of the Deity to be; and if it fall out
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119039:37"/> that they at any time praiſe and magnifie it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe inferred but that their Devotion muſt be very cold and languid. For they will not allow any acknowledgments to God for giving them a body, or for that he hath gratified them with ſenſe and corporeal appetites, in the ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of which they place their Supreme Good; ſince according to their doctrine, they are not the work of his Hands, either in their Matter or Form, of which the one owes its being to the eternal ſeed of Atomes, the other to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency of the coalition that ſo fabricated them. Nor will they more extol the ſame Goodneſs for that ſoul that animates them; being they look not upon it as a preſent of his Liberality; they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd it (they conceive) from their Fathers, as Colts do theirs from the Stallions that ingender them.</p>
               <p>Then for the particular of Conſervation of Life, which conſiſts in the ſupply of Aliment, and Deliverance from ſuch an innumerable variety of Accidents, which the tender Providence of God averts from our heads, they arrogate it partly to their own Circumſpection, and partly impute it to Chance, deriding thoſe that either return thanks, or make complaints to Heaven about it. In ſo much, that if we ſubſcribe to them, we owe all the obligation of our Being and of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to our ſelves and to Fortune; and in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, wherewith this Life is plentifully encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, all the conſolation left us is to vent our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and exclamations againſt Her. Queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, we ſhall be amply revenged when we have reviled her with the appellations of Turbulent and Furious, Blind and Inconſiderate, unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119039:38"/> &amp; extravagant in al her actions. For as for that invincible Magnanimity, which cauſes the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans</hi> to triumph gloriouſly in the moſt deplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able calamities and exquiſite pains, 'tis a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to which they alone can attain, who are not onely initiated in the myſteries of the Wiſdom of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> but have been admitted to contemplate the moſt venerable of his Secrets, and have there beheld Pleaſure in ſo high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of grandeur and generoſity, that Virtue her ſelf do's homage to her, and reputes it honour to be received in the quality of her ſervant.</p>
               <p>Concerning Juſtice, to whom it pertains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict puniſhment for offences perpetrated againſt the laws of Nature and Reaſon, the Doctrine we meet with in this School is ſo far from aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing due Veneration to God in reſpect of the ſame, that their main deſign hath been to eradicate and extinguiſh out of the minds of Men ſuch ſcruples as they are poſſeſs'd with concerning it, and to implant in their room moſt impious impreſſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting to his diſhonor. I am not ſo ſevere as to account them of ſo horrid prophaneneſs as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that God deteſts Vice and Loves Virtue; and that being an excellent Intelligence and a perfect Nature, he cannot be deſtitute of the knowledge of the former's demerit, and the latter's worth, by reaſon and proportion whereof the love and averſion which he beareth to the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe objects is enhanced. Now if God be powerful, which they dare not deny, and if he hath an abhorrence and hatred of Vice, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily requiſite to the ſanctity of his Nature, what is it ſhould hinder him from exerciſing Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119039:38"/> againſt it? Is it becauſe mankind is not under his Juriſdiction, and ſo he hath nothing to do to ſuperintend over their Lives? That ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame eminent worthineſs of his Nature, which obliges men to adore it, gives him a right over them, if he pleaſe to uſe it, at leaſt as much as they take one over another. And indeed the eminence of the Nature of a Thing, and it's perfection above the condition of other Beings, is one of the grounds of the authority that it chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth over them. For this cauſe the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers teach that according to the Laws of Nature ſuch perſons as are indued in a degree extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily eminent both with Intellectual and Moral Virtues, and particularly with Prudence and Fortitude, which are the Qualities neceſſary for Government, ought to be the Princes of the World. Now Authority is a Right to rule as Superior, by adminiſtring the rewards of Virtue and penalties of Vice. So that if God be of a Nature ſo tranſcendently accompliſh'd, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thereunto men ow him honor and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Obligation to honor and veneration being an indubitable teſtimony of the eminence of that which is honored, it is alſo a firm argument of his Right and of his Authority. And truly, if men be exempted from ſubjection to the Deity, it will be no impiety to affirm that they are Gods themſelves. For it is one of the Conditions pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Deity alone, to be independent of any other thing, and to be ſoveraign to it ſelf, that is, to acknowledge none. Wherefore if God do's not puniſh the crimes of Men, it muſt be becauſe he will not. But not to will that a fact
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119039:39"/> be puniſh'd which deſerves it, eſpecially in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is in authority and power to do it, is in ſome ſort to conſent unto it, or ſurely at leaſt to connive at it; which is unworthy &amp; incongruous to a nature perfectly eminent in Virtues, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt it ſelf deſerving correction and vengeance. Moreover, what juſtice can there be in this, that all men ſerve God, ſome more, others leſs, and the <hi>Epicureans</hi> themſelves confeſs that all univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally ought to do it; and nevertheleſs he takes no conſideration or cogniſance of it, but loves thoſe that blaſpheme him as much as thoſe that magnifie and praiſe him, and ordinarily ſuffers the Good to be oppreſſed by the Wicked, and equally ſhuts his ear to the ſutes and cries of the one, and the blaſphemies of the other? and this for the only reſpect of not troubling the ſerenity of his quiet, and that profound peace in which he continues after ſo many Ages? I am not ignorant that it is one of the ancient complaints of men, and one of the objections of <hi>Epicurus</hi> againſt Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that the Good are here below inſulted over by the Wicked, and that it is not at all ſeen how Heaven provides againſt ſuch Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But the other Philoſophers have indeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored to refute it, and ſome of them have even gone ſo far as to aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt that if God do's not puniſh the Wicked in this World, he will aſſuredly do it in the other. Nor could any thing of fairer reaſon be expreſſed by the mouth of a Pagan or that more nearly approacheth to the ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſtians concerning this truth then that which <hi>Plutarch (Lib. de Sora Numinis vindicta.)</hi> hath delivered upon this ſubject. But the True
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119039:39"/> Religion is that which alone diſcovers theſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries to the bottom, and repreſents them to our contemplation wholly naked, with unſpeakable ſatisfaction to thoſe which conſider them. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Epicurus</hi> cannot exempt God from this blame which is unworthy of his Goodneſs and Juſtice, if he hath any, of ſuffering, that which he hath power to redreſs, the Wicked here to devour and tyrannize over the Good, and the virtuous and religious to become in recompenſe of their piety, moſt frequently miſerable. He might have aſcribed to him at leaſt as much care of Mankind in this particular, as every Magiſtrate hath of his Commonwealth, and every inferior Judge of his Precinct or Village. But under pretext that there happen divers things, whoſe cauſes and ends they are not able to comprehend; and that many crimes are committed, whoſe puniſhment is not inflicted before their eyes; and that ſundry upright men are in miſeries, whoſe deliverance they behold not when they eſteem it timely to appear, they infer that therefore God ſees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all this, or that he regards it not. As if a King had abandon'd the government of his State, becauſe ſuch a one is not taken out of priſon ſo ſoon as in their opinion he ought, or that another eſcapes the Whip in the place where he deſerved it, who perhaps two days after is broken on the Wheel for another crime in the neighboring Province. So likewiſe it may be reaſonably ſaid that in theſe caſes they imitate the raſh and precipitous judgement of an ignorant and impatient ſpectator, that do's not expect till the laſt act of the Tragedy.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:119039:40"/>
               <p>It may be further inquired whether the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> do not yet in a greater meaſure blemiſh and obſcure the Wiſdom of God then they do his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perfections. For when they deny that there is a Providence in God, ſeeing Providence is nothing but a foreſighted and rational conduct of things to their end, and of every particular thing to the purpoſe conſentaneous to it, it ſeems they conſequently deny that there is a Wiſdom in God. For it is the part of Wiſdom to propoſe to it ſelf ſuch a convenient end in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, as it is of Providence to conduct them to that which they are deſigned: whence as Providence cannot be without wiſdom, ſo is it likewiſe ſcarcely imaginable that Wiſdom can conſiſt without Providence. Unleſs perhaps they here turn about to their abſtracted ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and attribute to God that Intellectual Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks, and compoſes of Knowledge and Underſtanding joyned together, and makes to conſiſt in the perfect cognition of all things and their principles. But yet, I know not how according to the doctrine of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> this ſort of Wiſdom can find place in God. For conſidering that there is an infinite number of things which depend on the Will of Man, and that the inclinations of his will depend on the reaſons and objects which perſwade and move him; how ſhall God ſee thoſe things, if himſelf hath nought to do to look into the Underſtanding of man to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fect him with thoſe reaſons, if he ha's no regard to the objects preſented to us to move us, if he do's not manage them to ſuch effect as to perſwade and attract, if he neither incite nor
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119039:40"/> reſtrain, neither bend nor correct the motions of the Will? If they ſay, that he beholds events, and by the events may divine of the cauſes from which they proceeded, we reply that that is no more then the atchievment of conjecture and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane divination, not of the Wiſdom of a God who ought to behold effects in the womb of their cauſes, and not the cauſes in the aſpect of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. In brief, according to them, God may perhaps know the things which exiſt, but he cannot know the things which are to come any more then We, and the next morning is to him in as much darkneſs as it is to us, who are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very ignorant Creatures. Laſtly, to ſpeak openly, he is a very wretched God, if he be not as wiſe as the Sage of the Philoſophers, whoſe wiſdom conſiſts in governing himſelf reaſonably, and the things which are in his diſpoſure accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame rule. I am not ignorant that <hi>Epicurius</hi> prohibits his Sage to intermeddle in the government of the World, and the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commonwealth; An Opinion ſo ſtrange and pernicious to Humane Society, that verily in this appears a ſignal effect of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, that he hath not permitted all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men to become as abſolute fools as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Sage. For what would the World be, in caſe wiſe men ſhould forbear to meddle in it, but a moſt horrid and tumultuous confuſion, without Laws, order, and Society, and no better then a crue of cut-throats and robbers. <hi>Plato</hi> without queſtion had more Reaſon, when he wiſhed that either thoſe who ſeriouſly imploy themſelves in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119039:41"/> the ſtudy of Philoſophy were Governors of States, or they which govern States would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly imploy themſelves in the Study of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; and affirmed that in ſuch times Empires would be happy. But (to proceed) I will admit the Sage to leave the Commonwealth to go at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; yet certainly he will take care of his Wife and Children, unleſs <hi>Epicurus</hi> repreſents us a Sage worſe and more unnatural then Beaſts. Shall not God therefore take care but onely to provide himſelf new pleaſures perpetually, and imploy all his wiſdom to effect that they never fail and be ſpent, unmindful of thoſe in the mean time that ought in ſome ſort to be to him in the quality of children, if not for being made by him, at leaſt for the affection they have to imitate his Virtues, and become conformable unto him. To conclude, what kinde of admiration can any one have of ſuch Divine Wiſdom? What other characters can be given of God then that he is a perſon won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully dextrous and induſtrious to invent means to produce his own contentment, and render his felicity abundant and permanent; that imploys all the powers of his underſtanding, and directs all the ſufficiencies of his Wiſdom to that end: but for any thing elſe, he knows none of the tranſactions here below, or if he do, onely ſlights and derides them? Are not theſe very fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reaſons to inducement to venerate the Deity in regard of his Wiſdom? Is it not very ſutable to <hi>Epicurus</hi> to have been the inventor of ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Philoſophy, to inſult arrogantly over them that aſcribe glory to God for having framed the World in the fair order wherein we behold it,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119039:41"/> and poiſed the Earth in the middle, extended the Sea about it, and given air for reſpiration to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, for having modell'd all the Sphears of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and infuſed into the Stars the Virtues of their influences, for preſiding every day over the mixture of the Elements in the compoſition of bodies, and uniting Nations one to another by commerce; for maintaining States amidſt the contrariety of ſo many different humors, and conducting the Univerſe like an Artificial Machine according to the genius of each of the parts that compoſe the ſame? Certainly it is very eaſie to judge which of theſe two Opinions beſt deſerves that exclamation of <hi>Lucretius (Lib.</hi> 1.)</p>

               <p>SInce the <hi>Epicureans</hi> cannot render any ſutable honor to the Deity, either in conſideration of his Power and Goodneſs, or of his Juſtice and Wiſdom, which they wholly exclude out of the World and our knowledge; it remains that they worſhip him onely, either becauſe he is Happy, or becauſe he is Eternal, or becauſe we behold him not, or meerly becauſe he exiſts, without having the leaſt regard to the Perfections of his Nature. And it ſeems the Poet <hi>Lucretius</hi> refers all his excellence to theſe two points, that he is ſupreamly Happy, and is of an Immortal Nature. For to this purpoſe he ſpeaketh in theſe following verſes (<hi>Lib.</hi> 1.)
<q>
                     <l>Omnis enim per ſe Divum natura neceſſe eſt</l>
                     <l>Immortali aevo ſumma cum pace fruatur,</l>
                     <l>Semota ab noſtris rebus, ſejunctaque longe:</l>
                     <l>Nam privata dolore omni, privata periclis,</l>
                     <l>Ipſa ſuis pollens opibus, nihil indiga noſtri,</l>
                     <l>Nec bene promeritis capitur, nec tangitur ira.</l>
                  </q> But concerning that profound Quiet, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal felicity, it is difficult to comprehend of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119039:42"/> what nature it is. For to make up a Happineſs, t is requiſite not onely to be exempt from the Evils of which we complain, otherwiſe Trunks of Trees and Rocks would be capable of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; there muſt alſo be an injoyment of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments as are conſentaneous to nature. What therefore ſhall we apprehend thoſe of the Deity to be? Are they ſuch as conſiſt in corporeal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? Certainly to fancy to our ſelves a God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally rejoycing himſelf with drinking delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wines, and eating exquiſite Viands, and ſleeping as often as he becomes weary with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, muſt needs make us conclude him more brutiſh then Brutes themſelves. What appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is there that the ſupream happineſs of the Deity ſhould conſiſt in ſuch things, in which a good man would account it ſhame to take any? If the diſciples of this Divine Philoſopher ſpeak as they are taught, wherein are the conceptions wherewith he deſcribes the beatitude of his God ſuperior to the extravagancies of the ancient Poets, who ſeem expreſly to have written of the Deities which they celebrated out of deſign to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe them with infamy. If God place his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments in the contemplation and admiration of his own Virtues, being he knows none in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or if he does, they muſt be ſuch as are very ſmal &amp; inconſiderable, that beatitude conſequently cannot be in any great degree, nor conſequently the honor which the <hi>Epicureans</hi> perform towards him in regard of the ſame. In effect, if there be no more Virtues in God nor fairer perfections then thoſe which their Maximes aſſign to him, ſo improbable is it that men ſhould become raviſhed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119039:43"/> with admiration of his beatitude, that without doubt he cannot but turn away his eyes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them, out of ſhame and regret to find them ſo defective; Like thoſe perſons that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued with ſome ſeeds of Virtue, who reflecting to conſider a little attentively their defects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come diſpleaſed and bluſh at the ſame. Beſides all this, admitting God to be indeed moſt happy; yet if ſo be we partake nothing at all of his feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, it will rather be an incitement of our envy and hatred againſt him, then of our love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. Firſt, of envy; for who is there that does not reſent ſome kind of maligning paſſion when he conſiders the happineſs of another, and finds himſelf extreamly miſerable? Then like, wiſe of hatred; for what can he be accounted but a great Miſer and hold-faſt, and unworthy the love of any one whatſoever, that is able to make others very happy without making himſelf leſs, and notwithſtanding do's it not; who refuſes to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect wanderers into their way, and will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his neighbor to draw water out of his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? And although there were amongſt men ſo much moderation of ſpirit, that the ſupreme feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of God ſhould not induce them either to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy or hatred againſt him, yet is it credible there ſhould be ſo much piety in them as to be drawn to adore him becauſe of it? If he be rich (we ſay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbially of one from whom we expect no good) let him dine twice; and in ſuch caſes we do not apprehend we commit any offence, when we proceed ſo far as to contemn the perſon and his wealth.</p>
               <p>Now in truth, inaſmuch as the God of <hi>Epicurus</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:119039:43"/> is immortal, and never ſuffers alteration in his nature, he far ſurpaſſes our condition: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Duration of things, if they have no qualities to recommend them beſides, is below being the true object of honor and veneration. The World and the Elements have been eſteemed eternal by many among the Philoſophers, yet none ever ador'd them: and they which account the Matter of which all things conſiſt, to exiſt from all eternity, do not yield us one example of any perſon into whoſe thought it ever came to proſtrate himſelf and render Religious venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it. And yet there is no queſtion but he hath greater obligation to the World then to the Deity of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> as being indebted to it for his body, which was framed out of it; Whereas <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s God hath contributed nothing either to the conſtitution or ſubſiſtance of his being. Ought we therefore to adore him becauſe we ſee him not? I beſeech the Readers indulgence to me to beſtow a few words in laying open to theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the vanity and impertinence of their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Certainly, if we do not at all behold him, it is either becauſe he is of a nature ſpiritual and imperceptible by the ſenſes of our bodies, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though he hath a body, he withdraws it from our eyes, and hides himſelf far from our preſence. Now whereas ſome Philoſophical Sages have believ'd God to be of a nature not mingled with a body, they were induc'd to that perſwaſion by obſerving ſuch admirable effects of his Wiſdom and Power that they poſitively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a corporeal Being could not be a capable ſubject of ſo many tranſcendent Proprieties.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119039:44"/> And indeed being they judged by the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Underſtanding, that it was neceſſary for the ſoul, in which the ſame is ſeated, to be of a nature infinitely elevated above that of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it was but reaſonable they ſhould have no leſs good opinion of the Diety, whoſe producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are infinitely more worthy admiration then thoſe of the humane Intellect. But <hi>Epicurus</hi> not owning ſuch Perfection and Virtues in God by their effects, he alſo cannot reaſon in the ſame ſort. And if he could, though immaterial things have a great advantage above thoſe which are corporeal here below, yet it principally conſiſts in this that they are thereby exempted from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and mortality. Now beſides that there are certain bodies accounted not leſs incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then ſpirits, as the Heavens, and which might therefore deſerve as much veneration as the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we have already ſhewn that the perpetual duration of things, without other qualities to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them, do's not render them ſubjects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring our adoration. On the contrary, if God hath a body, and never diſcover the ſame to our eyes, we ſhould make but ſmall account of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were more luminous then the Sun. For whereas ſeveral Nations have adored the Sun, it hath been onely in conſideration of his light ſo radiant, quickning, beneficial and neceſſary to the World, and which makes it ſelf known to us in ſo many manners, which he diſtributes into all the parts of the World, and is therefore named the Eye and Heart of the Univerſe. Had he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſcended above our Horizon, no Nation had ever made an Idol of him in our Hemiſphere, for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119039:44"/> all the deſcriptions that could have been made of him. To conclude in a word, ſo far would men be from being drawn to the ſervice of the Deity, becauſe they do not ſee him, that there is even a natural propenſity in our minds to contemn that which we do not ſee, and rather to form Gods of Wood and Stone to our ſelves, then to have ſuch as fall not under our ſenſe: A vitious inclination indeed, and condemned by the Wiſe among the Pagans; but we are under the influence of an Inſtitution that is powerful enough to correct this defect, and root this vitioſity out of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Which the <hi>Epicurean</hi> can never attain to. For that which hath cauſed great and diſcerning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to penetrate ſo far into the knowledge of God, that they have been as it were enforced thereby to conclude that he ought to be honored with the exacteſt purity of the Underſtanding (without framing any material Idea of him in the phancy, much leſs to carve him in gold or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him in ſilver) ha's been onely, as I ſaid above, the contemplation of the mighty effects of his Virtues, of which <hi>Epicurus</hi> hath no apprehenſion. Moreover concerning his meer exiſtence, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that is common to him with all other things, good and bad, honorable and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, high and low, corruptible and ſecure from mutation, reaſonable &amp; unreaſonable, indued and deſtitute of ſenſe, the Heavens (I ſay) the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Brutes, Inſects, and Plants, he can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no degree of eminence above us in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, nor by conſequence can we own an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from thence, to render him our ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reverence. As for the expreſſion of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119039:45"/> 
                  <hi>Plato,</hi> that the Being of God is the onely true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that ours is no other then a ſhadow of that, infinitely inferior to it in dignity, he did not conſider it ſimply as a Being, but as an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being, that waſts not away with duration, nor is obnoxious to any kind of change, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in its eternity all the ſeveral ſucceſſions and revolutions of times, and all whoſe Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Virtues are as invariable as its eſſence. But this is not the ſubject of our preſent conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, no more then it is the meaning of <hi>Epicurus.</hi> Hereafter, I ſhall no longer doubt that the piety of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> is worn onely on the outſide, and lies wholly in ſhews and countenances.</p>
               <p>Of which we can ſcarce have a more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or evident argument then experience. In the Chriſtian Religion all the inducements are found, that ever led men to the ſervice of God among the Pagans, and an infinite number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſides. For it preſents us to contemplate in him an immenſe Power, an ineffable Wiſdom, an exquiſite Providence, an inexorable Juſtice, an incomprehenſible Mercy; and in the conduct of all things agreeably to the deſign of his eternal conſtitutions there appears an adminiſtration tranſcendently admirable. One Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes not ſo great recompenſes for piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and another denounces leſs horrid puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt Vice and irreligion. So that all that which the moſt devout Nations have ever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, as we ſhall ſee in its due place, hath comparatively been nothing but darkneſs; and all the devotion which their meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge enkindled in their breaſts, hath only been a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119039:45"/> dream of piety, and a very languid and faint zeal. And notwithſtanding all this the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people is very ſmall whom Chriſtianity hath incited ſeriouſly to fear that Great God who hath revealed himſelf unto us. What affection therefore can men have for the doctrine of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus?</hi> If the fire it ſelf cannot inflame piety in us, is it poſſible we ſhould be warmed by his Ice? Certainly if the repreſentation of thoſe rich com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions, in that God hath ſent his Son into the World to redeem us from our offences by an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious death, are not effective to incite men to his Love, there remains no hope any other thing ſhould have power to do it. Wherefore how can we expect the ſame from this imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God beholds from Heaven the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men here below, without being at all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith, unleſs it be with reſentments of joy becauſe they do not reach him: like as one ſhould enwrap himſelf under the coverings of a warm and cloſe-curtain'd bed, while others are half dead with cold, or ſhould ſtand on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore beholding a Ship in inevitable danger of being wrack'd. Furthermore if Religion be not powerful enough to induce us to the love of God by ſentiments of gratitude which we ought to have for his benefits, at leaſt the fear of his juſtice impreſſed on our minds, ſerves as a boundary to check the over-flowing of our Paſſions, and to retain them in ſome outward ſhew of eſteem of Virtue: ſhould this Fear once be removed out of their breaſts (although it is impoſſible wholly to root it out thence; what pains ſoever be taken to do it) there would be ſuch diſorder in the Lives
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119039:46"/> of men, and ſo dreadful an irregularity in all our paſſions, that there would not be left ſo much as a ſhadow of Virtue and probity upon the face of the earth. For ſeeing there are in our Souls, as the Philoſophers themſelves have obſerved, ſuch appetites as naturally war againſt reaſon, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting and captivating the ſame upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as experience alſo demonſtrates; and the Pleaſure of the body meeting with ſo many baits and incentives, there is no vice to which we ſhould not without all regret abandon our ſelves upon hope of impunity. They which are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Laws, peradventure might abſtain from thoſe wickedneſſes which are puniſh'd by them, yet would permit themſelves to act ſuch as fall not within their cognizance; and if they us'd any kind of Prayer, it is likely it would be no other then that of ſome in <hi>Juvenal;</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Pulchra Laverna,</l>
                     <l>Da mihi fallere, da juſtum ſanctumque videri,</l>
                     <l>Noctem peccatis &amp; fraudibus objice nubem.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides that there are yet ſeveral perſons, whoſe madneſs, being above the checks which the repreſentation of puniſhments uſed amongſt men ſuggeſts, is notwithſtanding awed with the apprehenſion of Everlaſting Pains. And then for ſuch as do fear the puniſhments inflicted by the ſtroke of Magiſtracy, or even by the hand of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who recompenſes debaucheries with the Gout and Stone and other ſuch afflictions, at leaſt they would not reſtrain themſelves from being wicked in thought and will. Now what accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervice can that perſon render to God whoſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119039:46"/> mind is poſſeſs'd with evil deſires? Or how can any thought of the Deity find admittance in that ſoul in which reaſon is dethroned to yield the rule to heady and precipitous paſſions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it appears, that whereas we are in ſearch of a doctrine capable to ſubordinate the appetites of men to Reaſon, and Reaſon it ſelf to true Piety, which is the onely ſource of Virtue, that of theſe people perverts the right uſe of Reaſon in ſtifling and effacing Piety, and by that means gives up the reins to the inſolence of our luſts and affections.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps be demanded by ſome, how it follows, that becauſe the ancient doctrine of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> is incapable of exciting men to piety, and repreſſing thoſe violent inclinations which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hurry us to vice; that therefore in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times, in which men have ſublimer appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the Deity then he had, not to mention that they are more fully aſſured of this Truth, That there is a God, the doctrine of the modern <hi>Epicureans</hi> ſhould be no more effectual thereunto? Is it reaſonable to bound the effects of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge men have now adays according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of what they had in the Ages of old? Should any advocate of that ſect make us this objection, we are not unprovided of many things to return him in anſwer. And firſt in reference to that truth which is the foundation of all others, That there is a God, ſuppoſing the <hi>Epicureans</hi> of our time to retain the diſcipline of their predeceſſors, That the world was not created by him, that he do's not govern the ſame, nor ever revealed himſelf particularly to us by any oracle, how is it come to paſs that we have a more certain
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119039:47"/> knowledge of his Being? ſeeing we have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons nor teſtimonies thereof, then thoſe which men had heretofore. And for that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notion to which they recur, how comes it to be more lively and deeply impreſs'd in our minds at this day, then it was in the minds of thoſe that liv'd a thouſand years ago? Are not they always the ſame race of men? and is it not always the ſame Nature that brings them into the World? But concerning the knowledge of the nature it ſelf of the Deity, I ſhall readily admit, that a man whoſe brain is better made then that of <hi>Epicurus</hi> was, would not be guilty of ſo many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities as he is. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> would never have deſcribed God after that faſhion which he hath imagin'd him. But ſo it is, that this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath never been ſo well diſplay'd by thoſe who have had no other guide beſides the light of reaſon, as to yield a poſſibility of founding a more diſtinct belief thereof upon their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at this day. For I am of opinion, they have gone as far as the mind of man, in the condition it is ſince the firſt Lapſe, is capable to attain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being extraordinarily aſſiſted by God himſelf. And notwithſtanding how great variety ha's there been among them in this particular? What abſurdities and impertinences have they not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted? The beginning of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Books <hi>De na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Deorum,</hi> ſupply us with abundant evidence hereof, where the opinions of the Philoſophers concerning this matter are recited. Good God! What dotages and extravagances do we meet with! <hi>Anaximander</hi> makes the Gods equally lyable to being born &amp; to death with us; and determine
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119039:47"/> to them their intervals for the duration of their being. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> affirms that God is a ſpirit dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed through the Univerſe, from which our ſouls are clipt off like pieces ſever'd from the whole, and ſo divides him into a thouſand mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of fragments. <hi>Parmenides</hi> fancies him to be a crown of luminous fire wherewith the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are inviron'd. <hi>Empedocles</hi> diſtinguiſhes not the nature of the Gods from that of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he conceives to be divine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, although they undergo an infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Forms. <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> will have an infinite number of popular Deities, and one natural. <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates</hi> is contented to aſſign us eight, of which he ſaith the Sun, Moon, and other Planets make ſeven, and the eighth is diſtributed amongſt the fixed Stars. <hi>Chryſippus</hi> holds that there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable multitude of Gods, though he ſeems to eſtabliſh one Principal, conſiſting in a certain power of Reaſon expanded through all the parts of Nature. <hi>Perſeus</hi> acknowledges no other Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties then thoſe which men have conſecrated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as they conceiv'd ſome conſiderable benefit beſtowed on them by any one. <hi>Cleanthes</hi> eſteems the whole world to be God, which alſo was afterwards the opinion of <hi>Pliny. Diogenes Apolloniates</hi> imagined that God was made of Air. <hi>Protagoras</hi> knew not what he is, nor whether there were any at all. <hi>Democritus</hi> jumbles him and hurries him like his indiviſible bodies, framing an infinite variety of images of him. In a word, 'tis deplorable to conſider how ignorant, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne, and extravagant the mind of men is in its imaginations: and although <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:119039:48"/> have had ſomething more rational conceptions in this particular, yet there is diſcernible in them always abundance of weakneſs and inconſtance. Nevertheleſs, thoſe Philoſophers, whoſe Fancies are rehearſed in that Treatiſe with ſo much deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, were men of as good entendments and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> of our days; and the greateſt part of them had moreover to aſſiſt them in this Meditation the belief of a Providence, which was a light to conduct them to a clearer knowledge of what they were in ſearch after. Therefore what are they able to do at this day, who beſides being not more intelligent then thoſe of old, do renounce the aſſiſtance of that aide. For in ſo difficult a chaſe, the former have undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly more advantages in traverſing the thickets, by being acquainted with the footſteps of that they are in purſuit of, although but obſcure, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſs'd and paſs'd over by bad ſearchers, then they who take no notice of any at all, and who if any preſents themſelves to their ſight, ſhut their eyes that they might not ſee them, or on ſet purpoſe expunge and confound them. The knowledge of arts is indeed growing by degrees to greater politeneſs, accordingly as men improve them by other inventions and experiences. As it is probable Phyſick is more ſkillfully practis'd at this day then it ha's been heretofore, by reaſon of new obſervations made in Anatomy, and new tryals of the Virtues of Drugs, Plants and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. But in caſe no diſſections had been made of humane bodies for this two thouſand years, or no new proofs experienc'd of medicaments, it would be neceſſary to remain contented with the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119039:48"/> of knowledg which the Ancients had attain'd to in that art. Now being in the opinion of theſe people, God is not in any thing more particularly revealed to us then to our Predeceſſors, If the <hi>Epicureans</hi> will keep themſelves to the Maximes of their Sect, they muſt either content themſelves with what they have received from them; or if they will eſtabliſh any thing of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, they muſt frame out new models of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which will not be leſs exorbitant: and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Cicero</hi> will be found ſuch as cannot at all be diſcredited. In his time the ſtudy of the Sciences flouriſhed extraordinarily, and the wits of men were poliſh'd to as high a degree, as ever they were in any other Age. Beſides their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, they had the benefit of their labors, who liv'd in the World before them at ſuch time as Learning was in the greateſt honor in <hi>Greece;</hi> and indeed it appears by their writings, they made uſe of them very happily. <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf was, among thoſe great perſonages, of moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and rare accompliſhments; to whom as none was worthy to be rival for the Garland of Eloquence, ſo that there was ſcarce any that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd or ſo much as equall'd him in all kinds of Literature. And notwithſtanding all this, at what rate do's he ſpeak of the Deity? Having introduc'd three Philoſophers of divers Sects diſcourſing of Providence, he concluds his Book with this determination, That he judged the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Balbus</hi> the <hi>Stoick</hi> who maintained it, more probable then that of <hi>Velleius</hi> the <hi>Epicurean,</hi> who oppos'd it with the greateſt violence. Wherein it is obſervable, that <hi>Cicero</hi> keeping
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119039:49"/> himſelf in this matter to that doubting manner of anſwering which was practis'd by the Academicks who dar'd not be confident of the truth of any thing whatſoever, and had for their Device that ſaying of <hi>Pliny,</hi> That the only certain thing is, that there is nothing certain; nevertheleſs when he diſputes concerning the nature of the Supreme Good of man againſt the Tenets of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> he ſpeaks ſo determinately to the diſparagement of Pleaſure, that he ſeems to have forgotten the ſtile of the Academy.</p>
               <p>But let us a while conſider how the truth of the matter ſtands. The Chriſtian Religion teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth two ſorts of doctrines. Of the former of which men have ſome notions, but confuſed and dark, beforehand. Of the other they never had any apprehenſion or intelligence, nor was it poſſible they ſhould. Now although the latter ſort contain nothing that is abſurd or repugnant to reaſon, but on the contrary correſponds and conſpires admirably with the other, compoſing therewith a Body of doctrine of moſt rare and abſolute harmony, yet notwithſtanding they are rejected by the people againſt whom we diſpute upon ſuch grounds and pretenſes as ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after declared. Of the other, which being il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by Religion, ſeems ſo much the more conſentaneous to reaſon for that there were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome ſeeds of them ſcatter'd in the humane Underſtanding, they admit thoſe onely that pleaſe them beſt, and then reproach the ſacred diſcipline from which they learnt them. And this is the reaſon by which it is come to paſs that even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that do not receive the Word of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119039:49"/> God, they ſpeak in theſe days with more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and evidence concerning the Nature of God, his Infinite eſſence, Inviſibility, Eternitie, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, higheſt Goodneſs and Wiſdom; hence it is that they diſcourſe more poſitively of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and immaterial being of the humane Soul, and of its immortality; and that they underſtand more exactly the natures of Vice and Virtue, and the natural difference that is between them. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs after all this they do not ſcruple to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of Lying and Impoſture, to whom they are engaged for the illuſtration of theſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant truths: whereas they ought rather to have collected two things from thence; Firſt, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Writers of the Old and New Teſtament have clearly taught thoſe truths whereof men ſpoke before ſo doubtfully afterall the indeavors that the acuteſt Wits of the World had us'd for their diſcovery, it muſt neceſſarily be that they received illumination from ſome other perſon; conſidering that they profeſs every one of himſelf and of one another, that as to the natural viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their Underſtandings there was nothing extraordinary in them, and openly confeſs that there is no praiſe at all due to them for the ſame. For if we have regard to the good opinion which men naturally have of themſelves, and how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly they vaunt of their inventions, what praiſe might not thoſe Perſons challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for having taught us what God is; ſeeing we meet with One in the records of Story, that exalts himſelf to the ſkies for explaining a paſſage of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> better then they had done who attempted it before his days, and for having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119039:50"/> an intricate verſe of <hi>Pindar?</hi> Had they had the leaſt part of the vanity which <hi>Epicurus</hi> had for himſelf, when in the midſt of his Fits of the Stone, he found ſuch cordial and ſoveraign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in the memory of his excellent inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Philoſophy; or of the vanity which his Diſciples had in his behalf, when for the ſame reaſon they plac'd him in the rank of the Gods, they might on better grounds have fill'd the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with their boaſtings. A ſecond thing is, that ſince they were ſo happy in the bringing to light things of ſuch excellence, and to which the Reaſon of man ſubſcribes, we ought not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage their veracity in that which we are not able to comprehend; in regard they make proſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion themſelves that they do not abſolutely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the ſame, and acknowledge their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereunto. For it is hereby moſt apparent, that they have not ſought the commendation of having a mind able to ſoar above the common flight of others, nor affected obſcurity to the end to render their doctrine more venerable, or to reſerv the underſtanding thereof for ſome of their familiar diſciples, as we find related concerning ſome of the writings of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would therefore be an honeſt modeſty to yield them as much at leaſt as <hi>Socrates</hi> did to <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus,</hi> when judging that which he underſtood of his Book excellent and admirable, he adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to promiſe himſelf that what he did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand was ſo alſo. There appears to be no doubt but that there is a proportion between the Circle &amp; the Square, ſince none would have imployed ſo much pains in the ſearch of it, unleſs they had
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119039:50"/> eſteemed thoſe two Figures to be commenſurable. Nevertheleſs all the great Geometricians of our own and precedent Ages, have labor'd unſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in finding it out; and by how much they have been more accurately learned, and their wits more ſubtle in this ſpeculation, ſo much the more have their imaginations concerning it been attended with impertinence. Wherefore, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure any perſon ſhould be found at this day that were able to teach us the Quadrature of the Circle with ſuch clearneſs, that the minds of all men ſhould become enforc'd to acquieſce in the evidence of his Demonſtrations (although it be but a thing of the nature of thoſe that ſeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall to the ſtrength of our minds) it were ſcarce reaſonable to queſtion, but that he was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored by ſome Underſtanding more then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. And the inducement to believe that he was ſo, would be ſo much the greater, in caſe he were known to be otherwiſe one of mean capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, little vers'd in the ſubtilty of ſuch high ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and that he ſhould diſown the glory of having diſcover'd that truth by his own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors. I add moreover, that if ſuch perſon ſhould offer to our approbation ſome other Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Propoſitions, which we ſhould not be able to underſtand, yet it would be unmeet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and condemn them, after having had ſuch a ſingular proof of him in a matter ſo deſperate. It would be neceſſary to wait till ſome other ſhould riſe up either in the preſent times or the future, to explicate them, as he had reſolved a difficulty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably attempted, and at laſt abandoned by all the great Mathematicians in all Ages. Certainly,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119039:51"/> therefore, it is greater juſtice to practiſe that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty towards thoſe, who in a matter of moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſublimeneſs have revealed ſecrets to us which are incomparably more difficult to be found out by the mind of Man, then any Problems whatſoever of Geometry, &amp; which ſince they have been diſcover'd, give more abundant content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then the moſt evident Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. But theſe people manage the matter like thoſe Plagiaries that pilfer the Manuſcripts of learned men, of which they retain what they pleaſe, and publiſh the ſame under their own Names, to have the reputation thereof, and then in other things which they cannot reliſh, they indeavor to caſt affronts upon them, whoſe glory they have fraudulently intitl'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, what I beſeech you, are the particulars of their accuſation, whereby they arraign the Holy Writers of Ignorance, or Impertinence? Firſt, that they avouch the Deity to be the Creator of all things; and next, that they attribute to him an eſpecial care of humane affairs: two points which they cannot digeſt, becauſe prejudicial to his Quiet, and inconſiſtent with the profound calme of his Beatitude. What bars (they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) and Iron-crows did God make uſe of, to raiſe and adjuſt the pieces of this great Fabrick? What anxiety and ſolicitude would continually poſſeſs him, if he ſhould concern himſelf in the innumerable affairs of mankind? What regrets &amp; perurbations would be cauſed to him by all the provocations of injuries and indignities that are committed amongſt us? How greatly troubleſom it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119039:51"/> would be to him, like criminal judges, to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways his hands in blood? How it would excite him to tenderneſs and compaſſion to behold the piteous condition of ſo many miſerable wretches as are in the world? Poor people! that fancy ſuch a God as reſembles themſelves, and that can do nothing but with labor, becauſe themſelves know not how to place a beam in an edifice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Levers and Cranes? If he be a God, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; and if he be infinite, his power is not at all confined. Now to an infinite power, what needs there more then a twinkle of the eye, one ſingle motion of his will, to build not onely one, but a thouſand worlds? For why is it that men imploy ſo many engines, but onely to aid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſame where there own power is too ſhort? why do they make uſe of Pulleys, but to ſupply the weakneſs of their arms? and why of their armes and hands, but becauſe things are not obedient to their wills, unleſs, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them thereunto? But to him that is infinitely powerful, there needs neither hands nor En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, becauſe his will is alone ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the effect. And there is the ſame facility in government of the World, as in his Creation. Things require our induſtry and pains to know them, becauſe we are not able to penetrate far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and remain ordinarily arreſted on their ſurface, like the Dog that licks the outſide of the glaſs wherein the Pulſe is incloſed. Moreover, it is neceſſary for the Ideas of the things we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to enter into our minds ſucceſſively, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are too narrow to admit the ſame all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; agreeably to what we obſerve in Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſes,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119039:52"/> which receive but one image at a time; ſo that he that attempts to repreſent more, confounds all. In like manner we move about to diſpoſe things in order; becauſe we are but in one place, and thence it is requiſite for us in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſeveral things to one and the ſame end to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move our ſelves often from place to place; as alſo in caſe they be difficult to manage, we are neceſſitated to imploy the hands of another, and ſo frequently create ſubſtitutes to our prejudice and loſs. But he that beholds all things with one glance, that is preſent every where, that pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates all things in the abſtruſities of their nature and eſſence, and manages them all according to his Will, without any reluctation or reſiſtence, what pains can we imagine it to be to him to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the World? The Events of things fill us with anxiouſneſs and perplexity, becauſe they are not in our hands, and for the moſt part their iſſues are contrary to our hopes. But as for him that decrees them, and by conſequence foreſees them infallibly, what ſolicitous ſuſpenſe can they create in him? They fear leaſt he ſhould ſuffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of his Reſt, by being continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd againſt ſome, and affected with compaſſion towards others, Will they therefore have him to know the things that are done here below, or to be ignorant of them? If he be ignorant of them, it will follow that the God which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore is ſcarce ſo knowing as we. For not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the tranſactions of the World, and there being nothing done out of it, he will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the object of that his ſupreme Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, except his own nature: his nature, I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119039:52"/> ſay, which we have demonſtrated above cannot be but wholly contemptible according to their doctrines. And if he knows nothing of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor we bear towards him, it is loſt labor to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him any. But if the worlds affairs be known to him, they do not give him leſs trouble by not reducing them to due order, then if he ſhould ſtretch forth his hand to provide for the wellfare of the World. There is no appearance of reaſon why his Paſſions ſhould be more mov'd by being provident concerning it, then by leaving all to go in confuſion. But theſe people are as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, become fools by their pretended wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For all theſe objections have no other grounds, but our cloathing of God with our paſſions, and framing of him according to the model of our own Being. If he be made in the ſame manner we are, if he reſents our perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in himſelf, he is not God, he is Man. Which is as if a Piſmire ſhould apprehend of a great King, that it were not competible to him to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf with the care of any thing, becauſe ſhe toyls with drawing a grain of wheat to her little cave, or is forc'd to encounter with a worm that devours it from her. Verily God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts puniſhment on the wicked for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without being thereby obnoxious to any emotion interruptive of his quiet, becauſe his vengeance is not executed in choler as ours is, being carried thereunto by no other motive then for that he is Juſt. But Juſtice is a Virtue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from all paſſion and turbulent agitation. He hath a tender care over the Good, without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the agitations and heats in his bowels which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119039:53"/> we do. For he is not ſubject to our Evils. Wherefore having no communion of nature with us, he doth not behold or acknowledge the image of his natural condition in our calamities, and fears not leaſt the like ſhould befall himſelf; which is the principal and uſual cauſe of our compaſſions. He hath regard to them becauſe he is Good. Now Goodneſs is a propenſity to do Good, and not a perturbation excited in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and accompanied with regret or anguiſh. But theſe frivolus objections are profeſſedly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in whole Treatiſes, to which I refer the Readers, to avoid detaining them with fruitleſs repetitions. Let us therefore proceed to ſome other conſiderations which are more important to the matter in hand.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119039:53"/> would be a work unprofitably undertaken, And I cannot but wonder that eſpecially in our times there ſhould be people that yet call it into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and who have not been able to learn neither from Earth, nor Heaven, nor Men, nor Angels, nor from the mouth of God, a thing that publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf ſo loudly and clearly. I ſhall onely make ſome reflections concerning the natural motions of our Hearts, which may afford us ſome underſtanding thereof. I would therefore will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly demand of theſe people, whether they judge that there is any natural difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Vice and Virtue, ſo that Vice is naturally blamable and evil, Virtue, on the contrary, honeſt and commendable in it ſelf: or, whether they conceive this diſtinction to have been introduc'd onely to keep men in order, and to diſcipline Commonwealths, although otherwiſe they are things in their own nature indifferent. For if they be of the Opinion that <hi>Archelaus</hi> was of (from whom <hi>Epicurus, Ariſtippus, Carneades,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers learnt it) that there is nothing in the naked eſſence of things that diſcriminates them, and that the difference we find in them is proceeded onely from cuſtome, and as they ſpeak, from Poſitive Law; whence comes that deſire we are all poſſeſs'd with, of being, if not really, at leaſt ſeemingly honeſt perſons; in ſo much that the moſt wicked are offended when they are taken for ſuch as they are, and endeavor as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they can to cloath their wickedneſſes with the appearances of uprightneſs and probity. Certainly, that deſire could never be ſo univerſal, were it not alſo natural; and it could not be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119039:54"/> unleſs there be an eſſential difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that from which we are deſirous to attain honor, and that for which we fear to meet with blame. For why ſhould Nature have inſpir'd and principled us to prize the one more then the other, or rather to love and affect the one, and have a kind of abhorrence of the other, if ſhe her ſelf had not placed more value and eſteem on the one, and blaſted the other with ſome marks of her improbation and hatred? And ſeeing there is oftentimes difficulty in the exerciſe of Virtue, by reaſon of the conflict of our ſenſual appetites, which reſiſt the influences of that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our minds; and that on the other ſide, it ſeems there are ſo many delights and pleaſures in Vice which give it an eaſie victory and dominion over our appetites, how comes it to paſs that that which we call Virtue hath notwithſtanding ſo much power over our minds, as to oblige us to render it this advantageous teſtimony? Indeed, as there is, perhaps, no vice of ſo univerſal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as that of hypocriſie, ſo neither is there any that more clearly atteſts the excellence of Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs and Honeſty. For if Juſtice and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty is not able to obtain the rule of our affections, which are in ſubjection to its enemy, it appears at leaſt that its Idea cannot be driven out of the underſtanding, and that it enforces the Vitious to give ſentence of condemnation againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Epicurus</hi> inſtructs his Sage to be careful of his reputation ſo far, as not to ſuffer himſelf to be contemn'd; becauſe, ſay his followers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt brings along with it very many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, which cannot conſiſt with Pleaſure, but
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119039:54"/> are deſtructive to it; ſo that if he owns no other motive to maintain a good eſteem of himſelf but that, then provided he be able to ſecure himſelf from contempt by any other means, he will not be ſolicitous of having a good reputation. Now he that ſets no value at all upon a good repute, is as careleſs of the actions that produce it. For Renown ſtands in relation to the actions and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of Virtue, as the images that are emanent from the qualities of ſenſible things are to them and the bodies cloathed with them. And the minds of men that judge of us and our actions are as the Mirrors that receive thoſe images. Therefore, as, if it were indifferent to <hi>Epicurus</hi> in what manner a Looking-glaſs did repreſent him, and what images proceeded from his body, fair or foul, of a pleaſant or horrid colour, well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd in their parts and lineaments or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd and extravagant, he would give us to to judge that he did not trouble himſelf about the qualifications and ſtructure of his Body; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the contempt that he ſhould make of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation would ſufficiently diſcover the little care he had of the conſtitution of his Soul. But to be thus qualified a man muſt be both wicked and impudent in the higheſt degree; which would be a wonderful quality for the perfection of a Wiſe man. However, as it is extremely ſutable for an honeſt perſon to Love Virtue for it ſelf, and to indeavor to imitate him of whom the <hi>Athenians</hi> gave this Character, <hi>He deſires not to ſeem Juſt, but to be ſo;</hi> So that the perverſe judgement that is made of him and his actions, do not drive him to deſert it and diſcourage him from continuing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119039:55"/> ſuch: ſo it is natural to men, and principally to the moſt Virtuous, to deſire that their Virtue be acknowledged, and eſteemed according to its due value; becauſe, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, this is its natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al recompenſe.</p>
               <p>But to come neerer to the matter in hand, If it be indifferent of it ſelf to be Vitious or Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I demand, whether it be alſo an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing to render honor to the Deity, or not. For if it be indifferent, the <hi>Epicureans</hi> are in the wrong when they enjoyn it as meet to venerate the Deity, in regard of the eminence of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and his natural perfection. Becauſe that excellence of his Being is not from Poſitive Law, but natural; otherwiſe men might make and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make Gods at their pleaſures, as they do their Statues. Either, therefore, the <hi>Epicureans</hi> are abſolutly without Religion, and as much aliens to it as Beaſts; or the honor which they make profeſſion of rendring to the Deity, they do not aſcribe to him out of obedience to the Laws of Commonwealths, every one in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but becauſe they find themſelves naturally oblig'd thereunto. For in caſe it befell them to be in ſome place, where it were forbidden to ſerve God, would they comply with ſuch prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition? And if it were alſo commanded there to blaſpheme him, or preach that there is none at all, could they obey thoſe Laws without doing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to their conſciences? Wherefore if there be of neceſſity ſome natural difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween piety and impiety towards God, there muſt in like manner be ſome between Vice and Virtue in comportments amongſt men.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119039:55"/> For as the excellence of the Nature of God obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us to certain duties towards him, ſo alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity conciliates and contracts certain obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations amongſt us one towards another. And when I mention conſanguinity, I do not onely underſtand that of Brethren and neer kindred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, but alſo that of Fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and Countrimen, and even of men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; becauſe there is an univerſal conſanguinity between them all, which hath its root in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of one and the ſame nature, and in the dependance and derivation from one common ſtock. And as the eminence of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the foundation of the honor which we render to it, ſo the equality of ours ſhould be the foundation of the juſtice which we uſe one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another.</p>
               <p>This the Pagans themſelves well obſerved, when they affirmed the World was a great City, and the ſeveral Nation as divers Quarters of the ſame Town; ſo that though there be certain du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that oblige us more ſtrictly to our next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, yet there ceaſe not to be other general ones, which are incumbent upon us towards all men. Add hereunto, that if piety towards God be a natural and immutable obligation, &amp; yet Vice and Virtue indifferent in themſelves, and onely good or evil by the authority of a Conſtitution which is ſubject to alteration; If the law which ſets a value upon Virtue happen to ſuffer a change, and the Vice which is contrary to it become recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by a new conſtitution, there will reſult a conſequence abſolutely inſupportable. For ſo it may come to paſs that a man may be at the ſame
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119039:56"/> time deſperately vitious, a thief, adulterer, falſe-witneſs, murderer &amp; parricide, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding very Religious toward the Deity, who will love and favor him in conſideration of his piety, if he hath any knowledge of the ſame. Which is a prodigious conceipt, and ſuch as without further debate the common ſenſe of men abhors. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over there is no perſon ſo devoid of eyes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, who acknowledges not ſome natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral difference between the Beauty and Deformity of our Bodies, and that the advantage of the one above the other doth not conſiſt meerly in the opinion of men and cuſtom, as the comlineſs or ill-beſeemingneſs of the greateſt part of habits and faſhions does, I am not ignorant that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion bears a great ſtroke in ſome ſingularities, and that we may account that for Beauty at this day, of which in Ages paſt they did not make the ſame eſteem: as black eyes, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Venus</hi> were, are more pleaſing to ſome, to others, thoſe that have ſomething of blew, as thoſe of <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> are deſcribed. But that is in things, wherein the natural difference is not ſo evident, and where every one may have his particular ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without digreſſing very much from reaſon. For otherwiſe, I do not think any man would deny that <hi>Achilles</hi> or <hi>Nereus</hi> was handſomer then <hi>Therſites,</hi> as <hi>Homer</hi> paints him out to us; and that a ſtrait man, and of a proportionable ſtature is better made then a crooked Dwarfe, whoſe arms reach down to his heels, and his legs are diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Is it then likely, that there ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Nature, a Beauty and an Uglineſs of Bodies, and none of the Soul? ſo that to eſtimate
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119039:56"/> things agreeably to reaſon and not after common opinion, the chaſtity of <hi>Lucretia</hi> ſhould not be more to be priſed then the lightneſs of <hi>Lais,</hi> nor the Virtue of <hi>Cato</hi> then the diſſoluteneſs of <hi>Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napalus?</hi> If it be ſo, imagine a Commonwealth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> in which it were as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent for a man to kill his Father as his neighbors Dog, to rob in the corners of Woods as to hunt Hares or Deer, to lye with his Siſter as with a Wiſe eſpouſed out of the degrees of conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which circumſcribe Marriages, and to be as honeſt a thing to Lye and perjure, as we account it here to be ſincere in words and proceedings; it will follow that that Republike is regulated with as good conſtitutions and laws as the beſt polici'd that is in <hi>Europe.</hi> For ſuch is the nature of things indifferent, that they take their tincture from the moſt received opinions, and weigh on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the ſtandard of policy and Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law. But theſe are not barely extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they are diſtempers and frenſies, which the conſent of all people gives the Lye to, and that relick of ſhame, which Nature hath left amongſt the moſt corrupted Nations, utterly diſowns and flyes from. In ſincerity, is there ſomething in Truth that advantages it naturally above a Lye? or is it preferred meerly by reaſon of cuſtome? As much, without doubt, as there is of difference between Being and not Being, ſo is there of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between Truth that reſults from the Being of things and is the repreſentation of them; and Falſity, which is as the image of not-Being. Hence it is, that the perfection of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Man conſiſting in the knowledge of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119039:57"/> things which Are, conformably to their Being, and conſequently in Truth: there muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be an inviolable relation between the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of things and our Underſtandings, which are improved and perfectionated thereby; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they reject a Lye by a natural averſion, as ſoon as they know it to be ſuch. And this Love of Truth hath ever appear'd uniformly in all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſouls. Even little children do not readily take pleaſure in ſtories that are told them, unleſs ſo far as they fancy them to be true.</p>
               <p>Now is there a Thing naturally determin'd to ennoble our Underſtandings, which cannot be changed by Cuſtomes or Laws, Opinions or Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and which remains always equal to it ſelf and unvariable, and is there not alſo ſomething naturally determin'd to render our other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties perfect? I mean our Appetites and our Wills over which our Underſtandings preſide. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it would be a very extravagant thing, if Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whereby a Man is a Man, ſhould find its perfection in the ſole knowledge of Truth, and that in this we excell the condition of Beaſts who are not capable of comprehending it; and in the mean time, for our Affections, which ought to follow reaſon, there ſhould be no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and Creatures that are deſtitute of it, by reaſon of which their appetites are wil'd and undetermined, without ſubjection to any Laws of Vice or Virtue. But it would be a thing yet more abſurd and extravagant, if Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures unfurniſhed of Reaſon, having every one their proper and natural goodneſs, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a certain perfection of their actions (as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119039:57"/> we give the Title of Good to a Horſe &amp; a Dog, for the ſtrength of their Limbes, agility of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, vivacity of their ſent and ſwiftneſs) and yet a man ſhould not be ſtyled Good, in regard of a conſtant and immutable perfection of his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, meaſuring them by the eternal rules of Truth and Reaſon. <hi>Heſiod</hi> underſtood this bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then theſe pretended Philoſophers. For he delivers this excellent Leſſon (<hi>Operum &amp; Dierum, Lib.</hi> 1.)

                  </q> Whereas the <hi>Epicureans</hi> deſire to paſs for Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers they ought to have remarked that Nature hath diſtinguiſh'd our faculties, to the end they might never be confounded; that ſhe hath aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them their operations in ſuch manner, that one cannot produce thoſe of another; and that to thoſe operations ſhe hath determin'd certain rules, in the obſervation or Violation whereof, conſiſts the Good and Evil, which inveſts them with the reputation of Goodneſs or Improbity, The Faculty of viſion which we have in our Eyes, is clean another thing from that of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is in our Ears; and the difference which diſtinguiſhes them, is ſo eſſential to their Nature, that it cannot be ſeparated from the ſame without their intire deſtruction. The action of ſeeing is ſo proper to the Eye, and that of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ear, that whoſo ſhould employ the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to receive and diſcern Sounds, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſtinguiſh the Colours and Figures of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, would demonſtrate that himſelf had his Underſtanding perverted, in going about ſo
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119039:58"/> to pervert the eſtabliſht order of Nature. That action of ſeeing, to which the Eye is deſtinated, is performed in ſuch manner, that he that ſhould attempt to ſee with his eyes ſhut, or applying the thing to be ſeen immediately upon the Organ of the eye opened, or removing it from the eye to too great a diſtance, or laſtly putting ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy not diaphanous nor illuminated between the eye and it, ſhould find it were to no purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Nature hath ſo ordered that to the act of ſeeing all the conditions oppoſite to theſe ſhould be exactly obſerved. Now what ſhe hath done in the faculties of our Bodies, the ſame ſhe hath alſo practis'd in thoſe of our Minds. There is in us one faculty of the Intellect, and another of our Appetites. And as our Underſtandings are deſigned for the knowledge of objects, ſo are our Appetites conferred on us in order to our deſiring or eſchewing them. The operation of the Underſtanding is neither good nor rational, unleſs it be accommodated to the condition of the object, to judge of the truth or falſity thereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the nature of the thing requires; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that of the Appetite good or commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, further then it is conformed to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſubject towards which it is carried forth, to deſire or avoid the ſame, according as it is naturally deſireable or worthy our averſion. And laſtly, as the rules of which we make uſe to frame our Underſtandings to legitimate ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and by that means to acquire the habitude of Sciences, are drawn from the nature of the things themſelves, ſo that even <hi>Epicurus,</hi> although he were no excellent Logician, compoſed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119039:59"/> number of Canons by which to regulate his reaſonings; So the Maximes wherof we ſerve our ſelves to ſteer our Appetites, to deſire or reject the objects preſented to us as is fitting and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and to contract the habitude of Virtues, are in like manner drawn from the natures of the things, whence we have a certain ſyſteem of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality by which to conduct our actions.</p>
               <p>And this is of ſo much greater neceſſity, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the things which concern Virtue, in as much as the operations of our other faculties are competible to us as we are Living creatures; which ſtate is not the principal of our condition: whereas moral actions belong to us as we are Men; which is, as I may ſay the <hi>apex</hi> or higheſt atchievment of our being, and makes the moſt excellent piece of our Definition. For it would be an exceſſive irregularity in Nature, if the moſt excellent Being amongſt all corporeal things, ſhould be able to attain a certain term of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the operations which are common to him with Animals deſtitute of Reaſon, and yet he ſhould have no certain and determinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in reference to thoſe faculties which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him ſo far above Brutes, that he thereby approaches in ſome ſort to the image of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In which conſideration <hi>Plato</hi> affirmed that the Supreme Good of Man conſiſted in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with God; which was excellently well declared, and is ſupremely advantageous, if whereas God is of invariable Holineſs, Man would give himſelf to imitate him by the conſtant exerciſe of an eminent Virtue. But if there be nothing fixed and certain in the Nature of our
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119039:59"/> Moral operations, ſo that it is indifferent to be Vitious or Virtuous, what advantage can there be in our conformity with God? For it will be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that the Nature of God is likewiſe indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to Vice and Virtue, and that he is as an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Tablet, or Wax, ſuſceptible of all impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions whatſoever, without being either more or leſs worthy of Veneration or contempt, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or Praiſe, for being either pure or polluted with Crimes, juſt or Tyrannicall, Good or Evil.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Epicureans</hi> acknowledge, what all ſorts of arguments conſtrain them to do, that there are certain Laws eſtabliſht by Nature, according to which things are accounted Good or Bad, and actions likewiſe Vitious or Virtuous, in as much as they diſagree from or correſpond to the ſame, they muſt alſo of neceſſity confeſs that there ought to be a Providence, which after the laſt Act is concluded will repay the rewards of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them that have merited them, and heap Vengeance upon ſuch as have ſtored up the ſame for themſelves by their evil actions. Semblably, as he that offends his Father or Mother, deſerves cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement; ſo in ſinning againſt Nature, in whoſe Laws is comprehended that of Fathers over their Children, and who is the common Mother to us all, without doubt we ſhall be obnoxious to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. For every deviation from the right way requires a correction or reducement: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the correction of a Perſon that departs from the precepts of Nature is his amendment; but the correction of a vitious action is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him that committed the ſame. Truely,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119039:60"/> the Political Laws by which penalties are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Crimes, are not onely juſt in as much as they are neceſſary for the conſervation of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths which their violation would ruin; they are alſo ſo, becauſe that wickedneſſes, though they brought no dammage to the State, are of themſelves puniſhable, and that Nature teaches us that aſwell in moral matters as in others, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres, which ſo far tranſgreſs its rules, ought to be exterminated, to the end their enormity do not turn to her diſhonor. But whereas Political Laws eſtabliſh penalties onely to corrupt actions, and do not puniſh intentions and thoughts; 'tis not for that bad thoughts and intentions are not as deſerving of puniſhment as actions; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the will and intention is not apparent either to the Magiſtrates or Witneſſes; beſides, if all evil aims and purpoſes, and ſuch crimes as are committed in the mind onely, were liable to penal animadverſion, the number of criminals would be ſo great, that the frequency of executions would beget too much horror, and the world would ſoon become depopulated and deſart. Now it is not reaſonable to puniſh any offences but ſuch as are proved by good evidence; and it were better the world ſhould be peopled with tolerable inhabitants, then to be reduc'd to ſo gaſtly a deſolation by puniſhments and deaths. Yet there are a ſort of intentions, which coming to the knowledge of Judges are capitally puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as thoſe which lead to attempts againſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Soverainty. In which there is not onely a bare regard ſo far, as if ſuch fore-thought de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign had grown to effect, the Commonwealth,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119039:60"/> which is under the Magiſtrates care, might have ſuffered conſiderable prejudice: but it is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in as much as, the prejudice ſet aſide, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign it of it ſelf is too abominable to be paſs'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with impunity; ſuch horridneſſes requiring to be expiated with proportional puniſhments. Therefore ſeeing the counſels of which wicked actions are produced, are naturally as vicious as the actions themſelves; &amp; which is more, the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not vicious, unleſs as far as they proceed from bad counſels; Whereas actions are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed becauſe of their enormity, there would be too notorious a Defect, and too great a Diſorder in the nature of Things, if there were not ſome power ſuperior to that of Soveraign Magiſtrates, which may give laws to thoughts and deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now if there be any ſuch Power, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the ſame have a clear cogniſance of thoughts and deliberations, that it call thoſe to account that are culpable therein, making their Conſcience intervene as a witneſs againſt which there lies no exception, and at length begin to puniſh them by ſuch remorſe as the apprehenſion of judgement begets in their breaſts, till afterwards it take a ſeverer vengeance on them. Now this is that which we call the Providence of God, which puniſhes a part of thoſe things which are done in this Life, to take away all miſapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that he endures others without exemplary puniſhment out of connivence; and to give every one grounds of belief that he refers them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, in which the Vengeance he will exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute on them ſhall compenſate its deferring by a greater meaſure of ſeverity.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:119039:61"/>
               <p>Of what I have now repreſented, every man hath ten thouſand witneſſes in himſelf. For the terrors which all men experience, when they have committed ſome wickedneſs, and whereof they do not ceaſe to feel the effects though they be aſſured of exemption from penalties conſtituted by publike laws, do ſufficiently declare that there is ſome thing that frightens us within, with the denunciation it there makes of another ſort of vengeance. Certainly, if there were nothing to be dreaded beſides the puniſhment which every Magiſtrate inflicts in his Territory; what reaſon is there that ſoveraign Magiſtrates themſelvs ſhould be terrified with the ſame? It is true, theſe people object to us in this particular that thoſe terrors are not natural, but are bred of the falſe opinion which hath poſſeſſed the minds of all men that the Deity is incenſed by reaſon of our offences; to which they add, that the profound ignorance of people hath augmented thoſe affrightments to them, as little children ſear bug-bears in the Dark; ſo that if we had not been prepoſſeſſed with ſuch a perverſe opinion by our Anceſtors, we ſhould have always lived free from that fear in a perfect ſecurity. They adjoin moreover, that if there be any ſuch natural Apprehenſions wherewith men are diſcruciated, they are thoſe of the Accidents of Fortune, which may arrive to all, the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which is erroneouſly aſcrib'd to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Divine. For ſo ſpeaks their Poet;
<q>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:119039:61"/>
                     <l>Nec miſer impendens magnum timet aere ſaxum</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But in caſe this were no better grounded then on a falſe opinion men have been continued in, whence comes it to paſs that the ſame ſhould have ſo univerſally poſſeſſed the minds of all Nations? For who is he amongſt all the people of the World that can avouch himſelf an exemption from theſe Fears? In every Nation what perſon ha's not at ſome time or other had more or leſs experience of them? Certainly that which is univerſal, hath ſome foundation in Nature; and that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts conſtantly, and maintains it ſelf alwayes in the ſame ſort, cannot but be very deeply rooted therein; on the other ſide, vain and panick fears are incontinently diſſipated, and are of very ſhort duration. Time (ſaith <hi>Cicero</hi>) wears out the Errors of Opinion; but it confirms the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſentiments of Nature. But there is ſomething more in the matter; which is that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome have more apprehenſions of them, and others leſs, yet all are deſirous to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, and to finde out ſome reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt them. For there is nothing that ſo harraſſes the mind or gives it ſuch anguiſh as Fear does; and there is no man finds any pleaſure in being tormented in that manner. How therefore is it come about that men have been ſo ſuſceptible of theſe vain terrors, ſeeing we naturally repell thoſe things that are enemies unto us? And is it not ſo much the more conſiderable, that there have been always found ſome people, although
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119039:62"/> they have been very rare among others, that have endeavored, as <hi>Epicurus,</hi> to deliver men from ſuch affrightments, by openly preaching Impiety either by words or example. For <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines that there were ſome even amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that were ſo devoid of ſenſe as to deny that there is a God; or if there be, that he takes any conſideration of humane actions by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. A ſtrange thing, that they which would imprint ſuch vain Fears in the mind of Men, ſhould have ſucceeded ſo happily and ſo univerſally therein, notwithſtanding all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural repugnances in us againſt them; and they which would deliver us from them could never effect their purpoſe, although they had the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of natural profaneneſs to favour them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? Do's not this ſurpaſs all aſtoniſhment, that the Fear of Divine Juſtice naturally diſquiets the ſouls of men, and cauſes ſuch painful agitations therein; and yet notwithſtanding, if <hi>Epicurus</hi> ſhould have mounted upon the Theater at <hi>Athens,</hi> and the Poet <hi>Lucretius</hi> gone into the Pulpit for Orations, and there preached to the people the contempt of God and his Thunders, that inſtead of recompenſing them for attempting to free men from ſuch a tyrannical opinion, the greateſt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches would have been ready to beat out their brains with ſtones? And that thoſe Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo inflamed with love of their Liberty, and an ardent hatred againſt Tyrants which affected the Domination over their Goods and Perſons, that they erected ſtatues in their ſtreets in honor of them that kill'd them, ſhould have ſo great an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence againſt thoſe which went about to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119039:62"/> them from a fancy which oppreſs'd and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranniz'd over their ſouls? Surely it muſt rather be acknowledged that Nature prevail'd, and the wrath of God, which is in a high degree reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to men from Heaven, and
<q>Quae caput a coeli regionibus oſtendebat.</q> And it helps not to alledge that it hath not been poſſible for us to be delivered from theſe Terrors, becauſe we have not been inſtructed in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Epicurus.</hi> For whoſoever looks nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly thereinto will, not without admiration, remark two things. Firſt, that there are very few men, but have a propenſity to Prophaneneſs; and conſequently every one is an Inſtructer to himſelf in the <hi>Epicurean</hi> diſcipline. Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the number is ſo ſmall that ha's delivered themſelves from the inquietudes of conſcience, that perhaps there never was ſo much as one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that became abſolutely freed from them, not even <hi>Lucretius</hi> or <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf. In ſome men, the more reſiſtance they employ againſt thoſe aſſaults, the greater is their importunateneſs; and they are re-enforced by the endeavors that are us'd to repell them; ſo that from Impiety, to which they would reſign up themſelves to ſin more at eaſe, without being moleſted by ſuch alarms in the midſt of their pleaſures, they fall into Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; like a fugitive ſlave, that is drawn back by the throat into his Maſters houſe, where he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to obey whether he will or no, for fear of the Scourge and the Torture. Others, indeed, go ſo far, that the pleaſures wherein they ſwim,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119039:63"/> and wherewith they almoſt totally ſubvert their reaſon, remove in a manner ſuch ſentiments out of their minds, ſo as ſometimes to make a mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thereof. But 'tis as when Criminals give themſelves to debaucheries in the Priſon. For when the fumes of wine are a little exhal'd, and they begin to think of their crimes with a ſetled conſideration, they fret and are excruciated with the horror of Gibbets and Wheels which are preparing for them. But if it happen to them to be always drunk (which yet is rarely ſo) yet they are in their ſleep tormented with horrible viſions and affrighting dreams. The ſecond thing obſervable is, that the honeſter part of mankind are they which feel thoſe Terrors leaſt; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that a good conſcience which hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Goodneſs of God and his inclination to Mercy, aſſures and repoſes it ſelf in the ſame: and notwithſtanding ſuch good men abhor that doctrine from the bottom of their hearts, that removes all fear of the Deity out of the Mind of Man. In ſo much that they which are leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with theſe Troubles, are the men that eſteem them to have their foundations in Nature, and to be grounded upon Truth. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they which believe them vain and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, are the moſt ſeverely aſſaulted with them, without being able to be releaſed from them. In which on the one ſide ſhines the Goodneſs of God towards them that love him ſincerely, and fear him awfully; and on the other ſide, his Juſtice upon them that diſeſteem him. What man was ever more outragious againſt God then <hi>Caligula,</hi> or who ever ſo audaciouſly contemned his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119039:63"/> Vengeance? And for all that, when ſo ever it thundred, as if the Deity had ſpoke to him from Heaven, he hid himſelf under his Bed, as if he intended to make a Buckler of it againſt the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt. Whereas in the midſt of the Darkneſs in which the <hi>Pagans</hi> liv'd, <hi>Socrates</hi> maintained his mind in that ſame tranquillity at his Death, wherein he had paſs'd the whole courſe of his days.</p>
               <p>But there is one thing highly worthy conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is, that the ſtings of Conſcience are never ſo ſenſible and ſo quick as when men approach near Death, or behold themſelves in ſome eminent danger that menaces them. And whence ſhould it be ſo, but onely that by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of Nature they preſage and anticipate with their fear the miſery that attends the Wicked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Life; Miſery, I ſay, which is ſo much the more horrible in the apprehenſions they have of it, by reaſon that they know not what it is, and becauſe all men have a perſwaſion that their ſouls are immortal. For if Death did extinguiſh the Soul with the Body, and ſo reſcued both the one and the other from the Divine Vengeance and the juriſdiction of Fortune at the ſame time, there would be nothing at all to juſtifie thoſe fears in reaſon. In caſe, I ſay, thoſe terrors were not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in us, there would be no perſon but would free himſelf from them with this conſideration, There was a time when we were not in Being, and one day we ſhall exiſt no more: which was the conſolation of <hi>Epicurus.</hi> But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then is the time that thoſe Alarms are redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the tempeſts increaſe their violence.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119039:64"/> Inſomuch that where there is leſt one ſparkle of piety and hope of pardon, men would not have this opinion true, That God hath no care of men, and that he prepares neither Good nor Evil for them in the other world. And where there is not ſo much as the leaſt ſeed of piety, although they are very deſirous that Opinion were true, yet they are not able to perſwade themſelves that it is ſo. And hereof the <hi>Epicureans</hi> themſelves ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply us with an evident Inſtance: For what elſe intends their Poet in theſe lines?</p>

Is it Fortune then? No, much leſs: For wherefore ſhould he ſay that ſhe takes pleaſure to ſhatter the grandeurs of the World diſdainfully at her Feet, ſeeing ſhe hath no knowledge either of little or great, nor whether thoſe be the bagdes of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or not, which ſhe tears in pieces, and daſhes to powder? It remains therefore, that it is that which we call the Providence of God, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſometimes takes pleaſure in convincing men of their vanity, and overturning the highneſſes and excellencies of the Earth.

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Opinion concerning the Immortality of the Humane Soul, and the Supreme Good; and what may redound from it.</head>
               <p>HItherto I have touch'd but tranſiently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Queſtions of the Immortality of the Soul, and of the Supreme Good of Man; and I now come to examine what they judge of the one, and wherein they place the other. Which, though they both require to be treated of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, I ſhall diſpatch with brevity, according to the univerſal deſign of this Work. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they of former times thought that the Soul ſurvives not the Body, and the opinion of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119039:65"/> the modern Sectators is doubtful thereof, ſome affirming, others denying the ſame; it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for me to ſhew, that if they grant that the Humane Soul is immortal, they are alſo obliged to confeſs that there is a Providence. I ſhall not ſcruple in the firſt place to alledge here for proof of the incorruptibility of our minds, The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all Nations, although I have already made uſe of that Argument in another matter. For it ſeems ſuch to me, as ought in no wiſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, unleſs by contentious ſpirits, who when they have contradicted a truth, of how great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſoever, think they have atchieved an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit of great applauſe. For I beſeech you, if the ſoul of man be not immortal, if there be no firm reaſons to induce us to believe that it is ſo, how hath ſuch a fancy been able to become ſo rooted in our Minds, that there is not any opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ha's a greater vogue in the World? Not onely the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who ſeem to have been better refined then other Nations, have been imbued with it; but the Barbarians, and leaſt civiliſed people have equally had this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the perpetual duration of their Minds; although the quality of their eſtate after death was almoſt equally unknown to them all. What therefore are thoſe reaſons that perſwaded them of it, and rendred that perſwaſion ſo firm and unalterable? Should I ſay, that all Nations have received it from hand to hand from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters, perhaps it would ſtir the <hi>Epicureans</hi> ſpleen to mockery; yet I ſhould not affirm either an abſurdity or an impertinence. For all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind being derived from one ſingle perſon, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119039:65"/> he having been indued with a more clean and particular underſtanding of his Being then others have had ſince; (becauſe the race of men ha's been gradually depraved and degenerate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diſtance at which they have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from their originals;) he imparted the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and knowledge to his deſcendants, which are ingraſted in them and intertained from Age to Age. And although it were no more then a tradition from hand to hand, which ha's been altered in divers manners by Lapſe of time, yet the principal part thereof, which conſiſts in the belief it ſelf of the Immortality of the Soul, hath ſuch a foundation in Truth and in Nature, that it hath been impoſſible, even for many Ages of time, which ordinarily decays all things, to prevail againſt it, or at leaſt to deface it out of the minds of Men. Now no Relation ought to be diſcredited, which is accompained with theſe evidences. Firſt, that no ſolid and indubitable reaſons can be brought againſt the ſame to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it of falſitie; as I am well aſſured there is none to be found againſt this of any reaſonable probability: And Secondly, which is equally ſpread through out the whole Univerſe, and hath been with extreme forwardneſs received by all Nations; and Laſtly, which hath born up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the encounters of time, and conſtantly maintained it ſelf in the midſt of ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>any revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of humane affairs; ſo that it hath paſs'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the remoteſt Iſlands, and the territories ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from us by ſo great ſeas, that they have lain undiſcover'd to us till within theſe laſt two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years. Is it not a thing worthy our marveil
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119039:66"/> that in ſuch places where men had loſt all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Original, and of the ſtreights over which the people paſs'd from whom they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, and where they have in a manner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten humanity it ſelf; they ſhould notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding have preſerv'd this belief, that there is ſome other thing in them beſides the Body, of greater excellence, and which ſubſiſts beyond their fate and aſhes. But if there be people ſound in ſome other part of the New World, which are fallen to ſo low a degree beneath themſelves and to ſuch a meaſure of brutality, as not to have retain'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them any ſhadow of this Sentiment (though I much doubt, whether there be any ſuch) their teſtimony ought not to be of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, not onely becauſe they are very few in number in compariſon of the reſt of the World, but alſo becauſe that it would not be ſtrange if they whom barbariſme ha's unman'd in all other things, even ſo far as to have no inclination to ſociety, ſhould likewiſe have extinguiſh'd in their Minds that impreſſion of Nature and the tradition of their Anceſtors. But, praiſed be God, there are other reaſons, which induce an intire belief of this important verity, and which hinder that this tradition is not worn out, as ſo many others have been, which had leſs firm rooting in our Minds.</p>
               <p>All men have been alike perſwaded that there is a God; and very few have doubted that he is a Rewarder of Virtue, and Puniſher of Vice. Now neither the compenſation of the one, nor the Penalty of the other, is always fully admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in this World, even in the judgement of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119039:66"/> thoſe who have had no great knowledge of the Nature of Sin, nor what puniſhment is compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereunto. And this is the obſervation from whence they inferr'd that there muſt be ſome other time then that of our ſojourning in the Body, in which that retributive juſtice ſhould be executed.</p>
               <p>Whence the Opinion of the Souls immortallity ingrafted on the ſtock of the perſwaſion of ſuch a Deity, hath fix'd its roots ſo deep, that it hath been impoſſible ever to be eradicated. And we have above demonſtrated, that it muſt either be acknowledged that thoſe two Propertys, muſt be in God, or that he is neceſſarily ignorant that they are in him. But there is hardly ſound any one yet, that has ſuppreſs'd Nature in himſelf to ſuch a degree. Wherefore there muſt be an other time then that of our abiding in the Body, which is appointed to render recompenſes and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Souls, ſince they are here diſpenſed ſo diſproportionately to Vice and Virtue. I know well that <hi>Pomponatius,</hi> who under the pretenſe of defending the Immortality of the Soul, hath fought againſt it, and making profeſſion to be a <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> hath embraced the ſentiments of <hi>Epicurus</hi> in this particular, anſwers, that although the ſoul of man ſhould be mortal, yet it would have recompenſe enough for the exerciſe of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in the poſſeſſion of Virtue it ſelf. Since it is a thing ſo excellent in its own Nature, that it is contented with it ſelf (as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> ſpeak) and that all remuneration which it receives beſides, is either ſuperfluous or not neceſſary unto it. But ſuppoſing this to be true of Virtue, that they
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119039:67"/> which practice it, are ſufficiently recompenſed by injoying it; yet it would not be equally true of Vice, that they which addict themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, are puniſhed enough by doing ſo. For the Impious poſſeſſing very frequently ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments of Life, that the moſt part of Good men which have lived in all Ages, have been ſcandaliz'd thereat, can it reaſonably be thought that there is ſatisfaction enough in this Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical ſpeculation, that in as much as Vice is the greateſt of all Evils, it is therefore a ſufficient pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty to their Crimes? Nature teaches us, and the practice of all Nations confirms it, that Vice being a Moral Evil, that is, ſuch as conſiſts in a thing which is of it ſelf diſhoneſt and meriting blame, the puniſhment thereof ought to be in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a Phyſical Evil, that is, ſuch as conſiſts in the feeling of ſomething which is contrary to nature, and painful to it. And there was never yet ſuch a Law-giver heard of, that eſtabliſhed a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to puniſh a man for Robbery by cauſing him to commit adultery. It is ſo natural to men to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem not onely that the Punition of Vice conſiſts in Pain, but that it is congruous to the natural order of things, that whoſoever commits Evil in the Firſt manner ſhould be repaid Evil in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that they number <hi>Nemeſis</hi> amongſt the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which denotes the indignation that we are inflamed with in beholding Good arrive to thoſe that are Evil, and on the other ſide Evil betide them that have otherwiſe deſerved. Whence, becauſe they believed it proper to the Deity to maintain the orders of nature, and to correct the irregularities and deviations that happen therein,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119039:67"/> they have ſometimes been carried ſo far as to doubt that there was a God, in as much as they obſerved according to their apprehenſion the Juſt and Pious evilly entreated, and the Wicked paſſing their days in eaſe and delectation as ample as their wiſhes. Every one knows the verſes of <hi>Claudian</hi> in reference hereunto touching the life and death of <hi>Ruffinus;</hi> and Antiquitie furniſhes us with ſtore of other the like teſtimonies. Yea it hath befallen even the Prophets themſelves to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim upon this occaſion;
<q>
                     <l>Does God in Heaven ſee what's done here below?</l>
                     <l>Does he obſerve events, and govern Fate?</l>
                     <l>For, lo, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly men like Palm-trees grow.</l>
                     <l>And Righteous languiſh in forlorn eſtate.</l>
                  </q> Either, therefore, there is a ſtrange Irregularity in Nature; or, being crimes eſcape with impunity in this world, contrary to what they deſerve, there muſt of neceſſity be vengeance reſerved for them in that which is to come.</p>
               <p>Now concerning Virtue, although it be native<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embelliſh'd with many beauties incentive of our Love, yet ſo it is that it cannot be it ſelf the price and recompence which appertains to it. For what is Virtue, but the fair habits of our minds, and particularly the good actions which proceed from them? And what is a recompenſe, but that which is given in conſideration of ſuch good actions, and which conſequently ought to come other where then from themſelves? In truth, there is not leſs natural correſpondence between Virtue (in which Moral Goodneſs conſiſts) and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119039:68"/> Phyſical Goodneſs, which is placed in the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and preception of what we naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, then there is between there contraries. And the diſcontentment which we conceive in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them which take pleaſure in Virtue, to ſuffer remarkable calamities in their Lives, do's not appear leſs reaſonable to us, then the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure which we apprehend at the Proſperity of the wicked. Which diſorder, when it happens in the nature of things that good men become mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, do's not leſs perplex the belief we have of Providence, nor leſs incite us then the other, to doubt of the exiſtence of the Deity. Witneſs that complaint of <hi>Ovid</hi> upon the death of <hi>Tibullus;</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Cum rapiant mala ſata Bonos, ignoſcite faſſo,</l>
                     <l>Sollicitor nullos eſſe putare Deos.</l>
                  </q> And although the Inclinations which induce Providence to compenſate Virtue, are not of the ſame nature with thoſe that oblige it to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Vice, becauſe the inducements to this Latter are ſounded on his Juſtice, the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of which ought to be exact and rigorous; whereas the former ariſe from pure Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Mercy; yet the notions which we have of the Deity not permitting us to have a leſs good opinion of his goodneſs and Mercy then of his Juſtice, the ſcandal is equal to us in both the one and the other defect. Thus, you ſee, the ſame Prophet, after his heſitancy at the belief of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence by reaſon of the Proſperity of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, immediately after complains that his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and his innocence were unprofitable unto him, ſeeing they did not repreive him from the Evils
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119039:68"/> which he continually endured. And he profeſſes, that this thought gave him ſo much inquietude and trouble, and the inequality of things ſeemed to him ſo prepoſterous and ſcandalous, that he could not well reaſſure himſelfe till he was enter'd into the Sanctuary of the Lord of Hoſts, and had conſider'd the End that is reſerved for ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And <hi>Claudian</hi> likewiſe declared his diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, till afterwards.
<q>
                     <l>Abſtulit hunc tandem Ruffini poena tumultum,</l>
                     <l>Abſolvitque Deos.</l>
                  </q> But ſeeing Death arrives equal to all, and that that of the Wicked (as the Prophet ſaith) is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently without regrets; and although it ſhould be accompanied with ſome thing particularly terrible or painful, yet that puniſhment do's not by much equal the atrocity of the crimes which they have committed; if there be not ſome other chaſtiſement reſerved for the Wicked to come, and ſome other recompenſe prepared for good men, the Conduct of the Deity does not remain fully enough juſtified therein.</p>
               <p>This conſideration ought to ſuffice rational men, to evince that our Souls ſubſiſt after our Bodies: but we have other evidences beſides of ſuch firmeneſs that they could never be defaced by Barbariſm it ſelf. For he that pleaſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider never ſo little attentively the capacity our Underſtandings have to comprehend ſo many and ſo different things, their agitations ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain as to fly from Eaſt to Weſt, and from North to South in a moment; their inconceiveable
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119039:69"/> ſwiftneſs in climing up in an inſtant even to the higheſt Heavens, there contemplating their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Earth which they environ as a point; the power which they have to remember paſt things, to connect them with the preſent, and thence to frame conjectures of the future, which are ſometimes ſo certain that they ſeem to be Prophecies; to embrace when they pleaſe in one groſs all the maſs of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and alſo when they pleaſe to ſingle out of it the moſt minute parts only; the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which they employ to diſcover the beginning of the World, and its annihilation; to keep a regiſter of times paſt not by Ages and years one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by Moneths and Weeks, and Days and Hours and Minutes, to almoſt an infinite diviſion; the exactneſs they attain to in calculating ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the courſes of the Heavens, that they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and point out the Eclipſes even for ſeveral Ages to come; and their dexterous vivacity in inventing ſo many excellent Arts and induſtrious Myſteries; in poliſhing, illuſtrating and piercing into ſo many, occult Sciences, and difficult and intricate queſtions: what can be ſaid upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all theſe perfections, but that there is ſomething in us of greater excellence then our Bodies, yea a ſpirit iſſued from the breath of God himſelf? And herein I dare appeal to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> themſelves. They do not ſtick to publiſh that their Philoſopher is worthy of immortality, and even to be acknowledged for a God, in reſpect of his rare inventions in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy; although the reſt hold him for a perſon abſolutely ignorant of the things which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119039:69"/> to meddle with, and impertinent in thoſe which he treated of and imagined he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Do they think then that that Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage (as they call him) who firſt dared to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the mighty power of his ardent ſpirit, to break and wreſt open the gates of Nature, to dive into ſecrets formerly unknown, to paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the flaming Walls of the World, and poſt over that immenſe ſpace of things with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to bring from thence the victorious knowledge of the Cauſes of the univerſe; that he I ſay, had no other Soul but a little Breath of Air that is diſſipated in dying, and I know not what kind of vital heat, which is extinguiſhed with this corporeal Maſs? And were it not a ſtrange diſorder in the Nature of things, that <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> ſhould have merited the immortality of the Gods, and nevertheleſs could not arrive to the third part of the Age of a Raven? For what advantage is it to him now, while he is mingled with the duſt of ſo many men dead before and after him, that others ſpeak of his ſingular devices in Philoſophy? And if the cauſe of his Life differ'd in nothing from that of a Horſe, whence came thoſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for which they pretend men are obliged to conſecrate Temples and Statues to him? Truely, as an immortal faculty is requiſite to ſerve and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the Deity, ſo for certain, in caſe he had had no other principle of his Life but a pitiful mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal puffe of Air, he would not have dared ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciouſly to encounter the ſentiments of other men, and taught Irreligion with ſo mad an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119039:70"/> as could not be repreſs'd by any terrors or reſpects whatſoever.
<q>

                  </q> For there needs almoſt an equal ſtrength of wit to do ſo well and ſo ill.</p>
               <p>Moreover if our Souls be corruptible, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult undoubtedly from the temperature of the Elements in our Bodies, and by that means are (howſoever ſubtle they be) corporeal themſelves. If ſo, how can they have any conception of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſubſtances, which are abſolutely ſeparated from matter? For there is required ſome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion berween the thing underſtood and that which underſtands; for which reaſon Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers affirm that by means of the conception of things the Underſtanding becomes in a manner of the ſame nature with them. How then, if we be nothing but Bodies, do we comprehend that there are things which are not ſuch? and how do we enter into diſcourſe of the Deity it ſelf? Muſt not he be a very Brute, that imagines that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie whereby we comprehend that there is a Deity, and diſpute of a ſpiritual and eternal Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and its Properties, differs not but in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat and refining of our humors, from the Faculties of Beaſts? <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> taught that an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding was either an act of the Fancy, or at leaſt was not performed without the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Images which are form'd in the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119039:70"/> upon occaſion of objects that ſtrike our Senſes. And like a cautious perſon as he was, made uſe of that Diſ-junction, to the end he might not ſhake the doctrine of the immateriality of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, of which in truth he ſeems ſometimes to ſpeak dubiouſly, but in other places renders ſuch advantageous teſtimonies thereunto, that there appears no ground of doubting but that he had very rational ſentiments concerning it. <hi>Pompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> as great a Peritatetick as he is, hath liked better to determine that the act of Underſtanding is nothing but the formation of ſuch Images. What picture then do's the Fancy delineate in it ſelf, whereby to repreſent the Deity, and principally in them who are ſo clearly perſwaded of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality of his Nature, that if it ever happens to them to conceive any Idea of him according to the ſimilitude of Bodies, they preſently condemn their conceptions, and indeavor as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to abſtract their Mjnds and raiſe them above all corporeal Beings, to the end they may have no other thoughts thereof, but ſuch as are purely intellectual? It is true, they are ſenſible objects which furniſh us either the matter or the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all our ſpeculations. But there is no man but knows that from thoſe ſenſible things of which our Fancie receives the forms and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, our minds elevate themſelves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations infinitely more purifi'd, and which retaining nothing of the Nature and condition of Bodies, ſufficiently confirm, that there are facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in us, which, though they make uſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal organs for ſome few of their operations, are nevertheleſs immaterial themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:119039:71"/>
               <p>To proceed yet further; There is no perſon in the World, but is deſirous of Immortality, and every one is convinced in his conſcience of ſuch an inclination. Whence therefore comes that deſire to be ſo Univerſal amongſt us, if there be nothing that is able to ſatisfie it? For the ſame <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath written, that the natural appetites are not given us to no purpoſe, but that there are certain things naturally deſigned for their ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and that Philoſopher is provided with ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable reaſons to juſtifie his opinion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where is that Immortality which we all ſeek after? Not in our bodies; Since all men yield to the ſtroke of fate. Nor yet in Statues or Books, nor in the Memory of men, nor in triumphal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, nor the Inſcriptions of Monuments. For the number of thoſe is very inconſiderable who have provided themſelves Memorials, that they have been; and of thoſe which have been erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this day, there are not above two or three in a manner whoſe durable materials have ſecur'd them from the ſilent depredation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Time. At the utmoſt, although the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Monuments ſhould have ſtill ſurvived, as the Arches of triumph, Pyramids, and Mauſolae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um's, yet they could not give the Immortality we ſeek; they are no more but teſtimonies that we are not to expect the ſame in this world; as they which want iſſue, take pleaſure to keep little Dogs, and to behold their Breed. It remains then, that we have a complaint to make againſt nature, who hath given us a deſire, without hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to content it; which is unworthy and diſagreeable to the care which ſhe hath had of us
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119039:71"/> in ſo many other things. For as for what ſome may poſſibly alledge that Brutes have almoſt alike inclinations, and that even inſenſible things are lead by a natural inſtinct to their own conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; 'tis a frivolous objection: Shall we ſay, that becauſe a Stone naturally tends downwards, it deſires to be there perpetually? being ignorant of the impulſive cauſe that moves it, or the place whence it comes and whether it goes, and even of its own being, it cannot, to ſpeak properly deſire its own converſation. The cauſe is, for that every thing which is heavy, falls naturally downward; if a Stone ſhould not do ſo, it would have no gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, &amp; were not a Stone. In a word, heavy things have as little deſire to deſcend down, and light to mount upwards, either from the regions of Heaven or the centure of the Earth, as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Two being doubled ha's to make Four. 'Tis the nature and order of things, which knows not it ſelf who would have it to be ſo. As for Animals deſtitute of Reaſon, all the care they have of their Preſervation lyes in that which we term the eſtimation of things preſent, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as they are hurtful or profitable are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired or avoided by them, without all knowledge of the future, or any thought that reaches ſo far: much leſs are they able to do as men, who anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate not onely intire Ages, but thouſands and millions of Years to come. And who ſo compares that blind inſtinct of Piſmires, which ſeem to provide in Summer againſt the neceſſities of Winter, with the thought of immortality, muſt either be an Idiot or a mad man. For, can any man of common ſenſe imagine that thoſe little
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119039:72"/> Animals have an apprehenſion that the Sun being returned to the Tropic of Capricorn, will have no more power to make the Earth produce what is neceſſary to their ſubſiſtence? Surely no: But that ſmall inſect being naturally theeviſh, as long as ſhe finds food in the fields, ſteals it from thence, and carries it to her little Cell, without dreaming that there will be a Morrow, and far from foreſeeing the Rain and Froſts of Winter; being notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all Elogies of her,
<q>—Ignara atque incauta Futuri.</q> But that Providence which governs all things and takes care of their conſervation, becauſe it created them, gives theſe creatures thoſe blind inſtincts and inclinations to theft, to cauſe them to lay up a ſtore of neceſſary ſuſtenance; as a Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner makes uſe of the ſwiftneſs and rapaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Hawkes, to cover the table of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with excellent fowl, without their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the deſign. But for us, our deſires are ardent, and our thoughts extend themſelves wonderfully forward to the Future: and foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the inquietude of ardent deſires, when we ſee no hopes of contenting them, is extremely importunate; in caſe we have no part in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, Nature will not onely have put the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of it in us to no purpoſe (which ſhe hath done in nothing beſides) but alſo to deject and torment us, which were a cruelty beyond the ſpleen of Stepdames.</p>
               <p>Moreover, experience it ſelf teaches us that there is ſuch a difference between the Body and Mind, that they ſeem oftentimes to have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion one with another; ſo different are their
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119039:72"/> functions, and ſo little mutation doth a great and univerſal change in the one work in the other. You may ſee a man blaſted or lamed in all his Members by ſome accident, who yet hath the motions of his mind as ſtrong, plyant and nimble as when he was in perfect health. You may ſee another upon the borders of the grave, ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated like a ſkeleton, without vigor and pulſe; whoſe underſtanding nevertheleſs is more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime then before, and his thoughts more refined, who will judiciouſly diſcourſe of every thing that is propounded to him, and that which is the greateſt wonder will do it with ſo little aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at death, as if to deveſt himſelf of his body were of no more value to him then to ſtripoff his cloathes; although he apprehend full well on the one ſide what death is, and do not contemn it out of ſtupidity, and is on the other abſolutely perſwaded of the immortality of the Soul. But it's true, this is not univerſal; and great mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the body ſometimes produce remarkable changes in the Mind. Nor do I deny but that the Body is ſo conſtituted in its particular temper, and ſo neerly ligued with the Mind, that the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one contributes very much to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and operations of the other. As when a Lute is untuned, how skillful ſoever the Muſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an be, he can never make any tolerable harmony; ſo in the total dyſcraſie of the Body and its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal inſtruments, the Soul ſometimes remains ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified and aſtoniſh'd. But ſeeing this happens not equally in all men, and that there are as many experiences of people who amidſt aches and mutilations and loſſes of their limbs have preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119039:73"/> the whole ſtrength of their Minds intire, till death, it muſt needs be that this Tabernacle lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſomething elſe that is of a more durable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Whence it is eaſie to conclude, that ſince it is not a Body, it muſt be an immaterial ſubſtance, and conſequently incorruptible. For being of a ſpiritual nature it cannot be aſſailed by external things which offend us, nor ſuffer from any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that befalls it from without; and holding nothing of the matter of the Elements, or their contrary qualities, which naturally encounter one another to their mutual deſtruction, it involves not in it ſelf any ſeed of corruption which ſeems to attend every thing that is compoſed of them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add moreover, what ha's been above demonſtrated, that there is ſo great a difference between Vice and Virtue, that he that do's not acknowledge the ſame, is unworthy the name of a man. Which how is it poſſible for us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, if the Faculties of our Minds be not different from thoſe of Brutes, ſince they have no underſtanding at all of it? For it is certain, that we argue from the diſproportion of effects to the difference of cauſes, and from the diverſity of actions to that of the Faculties which produce them; and laſtly from the difference of Faculties to that of the eſſence it ſelf of the things in which thoſe faculties reſide. If therefore Brutes have no knowledge of Good and Evil, as every one ſees they have not; and if we perceive an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtance between them, as reaſon informs us, and our conſcience acquieſces therein, and the conſentment of Nations hath declared in all the World; it follows that there is an infinite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119039:73"/> between our Faculties and theirs, and conſequently that the like diſtance is found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the eſſence of their Souls and that of ours. And I appeal to reaſon whether, being the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a Man conſiſts in the knowledge of the moſt excellent objects, and in the exerciſe of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the perfection of a good Horſe lyes in the ſtrength of his Limbs, and in the agility of his motions; whether, I ſay, it be not abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident that the excellence of the one lyes in his Body, and the excellence of the other in ſome thing, wherewith the body hath ſcarce any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication or commerce. Whence it neceſſarily follows, that their natures differ wholly and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in regard of reaſon, which alone is cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of conferring that perfection on man; as weighty things differ from light by the maſſive ſolidity of their matter, in which gravity is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and as the circular Figure is diſcriminated from the reſt by the roundneſs of its circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence equally diſtant from the centre. Of which the luctation and combate of reaſon againſt the corporeal appetites (which even <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philoſophers have plainly acknowledged) affords a teſtimony ſatisfactorily manifeſt. For ſince there is no ſhadow of ſuch reluctance in Brutes, who follow their ſenſuality without any rule, or check, and that the ſame is ſound in the moſt diſſolute men, in whom conſcience cannot be abſolutely extinguiſh'd; it follows that it muſt have its original from ſomething which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſtitute of that ſenſuality, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which is alſo not corporeal. Becauſe it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that thoſe appetites which are called ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119039:74"/> and are common to us with Brutes, have their ſeat and root in the Body, and depend on that Soul by which we have reſemblance with them, in aſmuch as we are Animals. Wherefore, whether there be in man two diſtinct Souls, one Senſitive (as it is called) by which we are Animals, and the other Reaſonable, by which we are men; or whether there be but one onely, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with different faculties, whereby we are provided to perform all the Functions appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe two reſpects; it is clear that that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive faculty is not diſplayed but in the Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo linked to it as never to be ſeparable from it; and that on the contrary the other is not ſeated in the body, ſince it is deſigned to check our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, which it performs oftentimes with very great violence and power. And this is ſo true, and ſo univerſally received, ſaving by the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans</hi> (who think they have won the Palme for noble inventions in Philoſophy, becauſe they have degraded themſelves to the rank of Brutes) that the moſt excellent perſons have been ſo far from believing the Soul to periſh with the Body, that on the contrary (not being able to conjecture how after the diſſipation of the Body, they could ever be reunited and render the whole man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal) they have affirmed that the Soul in which the Underſtanding reſides is really the man, and that the Body is not, but as the receptacle and priſon. But by the grace of God we ſhall ſee hereafter that man was created for immortality as well in reference to his body as to his Soul; and that being fallen from this prerogative by ſin, he hath been reſtored thereunto by the Divine cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and mercy.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:119039:74"/>
               <p>Seeing it is ſo therefore, that the Soul of man ſubſiſts after ſeparation from the Body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is of an incorruptible ſubſtance, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of neceſſity that there is ſomthing to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and feared from the Deity; and that though his Providence were not ſo cleerly intelligible in the world here, yet at leaſt his juſtice is to be dreaded in that which is to come. For what will become of the ſoul after Death? Will ſhe act, or will ſhe be buried in eternal ſleep? Certainly ſhe is of a nature ſo active, vigilant and averſe from idleneſs, that it is with regret that ſhe allows the body its neceſſary intervals of refreſhment. Even as plung'd and immur'd as ſhe is in it, when that is at reſt, ſhe is not ſurpris'd with ſleep, but is ever imploy'd on ſome kind of ſpeculations how unprofitable and extravagant ſoever they be. Like as a Muſitian, that is affected to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his Art, chooſes rather to play on his Lute, though half untuned, and at the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of making falſe Muſick and committing diſſonances, then to ſuffer his fingers to become torpid by continued diſuſe. And the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſhe is, that is, the more exercis'd in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous contemplations, the more ſhe hates repoſe, even to the abandoning all care of her habitation, though ſhe otherwiſe loves and is a good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion unto it. So that ſhe would be clean diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the end to which Nature ha's deſigned her, if ſhe were condemned to a perpetuall ſleep in eternal night. What then will her occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be at that time? Will ſhe frequent in Towns, or will ſhe reſort to unhabited placs? Neither of which is worthy of her, nor ſutable to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119039:75"/> Whilſt ſhe is here by reaſon of the body confined to ſenſible things, yet ſhe quits her ſelf from them oftentimes, to buſie her viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in the contemplation of thoſe which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual. For whatſoever beauty the World hath, it all referres to the body, and ſo it feeds and ſatisfies the corporeal eyes onely. If there be any contentment for the Mind, it is in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of that Wiſdom, from which all the excellent order we behold, proceeds: Which is an object deſtinated to the Underſtanding and not to the corporeal ſight. Much more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when ſhe is no longer in this lodging of Earth, will ſhe contemn ſenſible things, to give her ſelf to ſuch as are conformable unto her. And indeed the moſt excellent faculty of the Soul is the Underſtanding, and the perfection of that conſiſts in contemplation of noble and excellent objects. Now there is in the perfection of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing its ſupreme end and contentment; by reaſon of which, either the Soul muſt be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, which we have ſhewn is impoſſible; or ſhe muſt be imployed in the contemplation of things worthy ſo ſublime an intelligence. And what can there be, even in the opinion of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> more worthy to be conſidered, lov'd, and ador'd then God, or conſequently which ſo much perfectionates the ſoul of man and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or which gives him ſo much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and joy? Therefore his ſupreme Pleaſure will be to approach unto God, to behold and know him, to dive into his wonderful nature, as much as is poſſible to be founded in ſo great an Abyſſe. And this cannot be done, unleſs God
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119039:75"/> communicate himſelf to the Soul, and ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be (as I may ſo ſpeak) touched and taſted by it. But what? If that be the perfection of the Soul, and conſequently its aim, is it conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous to Reaſon, that thoſe which are polluted with all ſorts of wickedneſs ſhould likewiſe have free acceſs to the Deity, and receive as high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment from his communication, as he will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Good unto? Or ſhall Fortune have then alſo a Soveraign power over ſpirits, to bring ſome of them fortuitouſly to their ſupreme Good, and as raſhly debar others from it? Certainly altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther otherwiſe. As they which have moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Deity and his image (which reſplends in Virtue, and not in ſenſible things) or who (to ſpeak better) have not eſteemed ſenſible things further then as they are neceſſary to the body to render their Minds more free to its functions, and dextrous to the exerciſe of Virtue, ſhall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their affections, obtain the injoyment of that which they loved here below (which is a thing agreeable to the Goodneſs of God:) ſo thoſe ſhall by his juſtice be deprived of the ſame, who have ſlighted it in compariſon of things viſible and tranſitory. Now to be deprived of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Deity and of that delectation which it affords in communicating it ſelf to the creature, is that which we account the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin committed in the body; which alſo cannot be without tranſcendent ſorrow, and unſpeakable diſtreſs. We refer theſe things as much as we can, to the experience of all men.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:119039:76"/>
               <p>It is not queſtioned by any, but that we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to a ſupreme Good, and that ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good is of it ſelf ſo great, that all our deſires ought to concenter in tendency thereunto. The debates of Philoſophers concerning its Nature, are infinite, and their diſſenting opinions about it can never be compoſed by the help of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. Not to amuſe my ſelf in rehearſing the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of others, which are almoſt without number, in the firſt place the <hi>Epicureans</hi> place it in the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Body. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> determine it in Virtue. And the Peripateticks define it in the exerciſe of Virtue; yet account it not complete, unleſs it be attended with the Pleaſure that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues from injoyment of corporeal and external things; ſuch as Beauty, Health, Riches, Peace, the love of ones Fellow-Citizens, and Proſperity in Enterpriſes. As for Bodily Pleaſure, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have long ſince driven that out of the School, as too ſoft and effeminate, wherein to place the ſoveraign happineſs of good men. For is it equitable to attribute the ſame to <hi>Lais</hi> with <hi>Cornelia</hi> the Mother of the <hi>Gracchi?</hi> or to <hi>Marcus Brutus</hi> with <hi>Heliogabalus?</hi> And what a ſtrange ſupreme Good is that which renders men of neer reſemblance with beaſts? Yet ſuppoſing it were ſo, experience ſhows that 'tis impoſſible to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. For who ever taſted a Pleaſure in the world, ſo pure, that had not in it a touch of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs? If any one ha's taſted ſuch, yet who ha's been able to continue and relliſh it for a long time? Whether ſoever Pleaſure be plac'd in a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble jollity for the injoyment of ſome deſired thing; or eſtabliſh'd in the Abſence of all Evils,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119039:76"/> which they call Indolence; thoſe Pleaſures which tickle us are but of a moments duration, and no man ever yet paſs'd an intire day, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of ſomething. Now the ſupream Good is a thing firm and conſtant, and which not only ought to be difficultly ſhaken (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerved) but abſolutely immutable. They who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd it to Virtue, were without doubt more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and worthy the prerogative of men. But there never yet liv'd any perſon, that attain'd to ſuch a degree of Virtue, as it ought to be had in, to make up a happineſs: for it is requiſite that it be accompliſhed in all its degrees and parts. The Stoicks indeed were arrogant enough, to imagine themſelves to have attained thereunto; but we have too much experience both of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity and our own, to believe them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome one ſhould have reached to that high pitch of Virtue, yet cannot he be called a happy man, who is ſubject to fall into the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of <hi>Priamus,</hi> and who really falls into them. If there have been any Sages amongſt the Stoicks, <hi>Cato <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ticenſis</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> were the men. And notwithſtanding <hi>Cato</hi> in deſpair of ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the affairs of the Commonwealth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd, diſputes in the firſt place againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, and accuſes its conduct of a ſtrange inſtability and prevarication, as if it had favour'd the tyrannical attempts of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and then kills himſelf, to go ſeek his happineſs in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, ſince his Virtue could not give him it in this world. And for the other, being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the ſame diſpair, he ſlew himſelf with his own hand, after he had reviled Virtue, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119039:77"/> her weak and wretched, as if ſhe were no more then a meer name or ſhadow. Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments of theirs ſufficiently detect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the vanity of thoſe magnificent words of the Maſters of their School; That a Wiſe man is invulnerable by all the Accidents of Fortune, and that he can never loſe the ſupport of Virtue, ſo unmoveable is ſhe in him, and always like to her ſelf. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ordered the matter better, when to the injoyment and practiſe of Virtue he adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the felicity which accrues from things exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Which opinion is no doubt more conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our deſires and natural inclinations. But though he had a capacity quick enough to diſcern that where one of thoſe two things is wanting, the ſupreme happineſs is defective, yet had he no more power then other men to conjoyn them actually and really together. In which impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of amaſſing a ſupreme Good in the World of ſo many pieces, and conſolidating them ſo well together, that their Union be never diſcompos'd, who ſees not the neceſſary deſpair there is of all humane power to obtain the ſame? Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of obtaining cannot of conſequence, but cauſe the purſuit to be abandon'd. So that as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath given us the Deſire to be happy, Neceſſity will have bound us down to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual deſpair of being ſo. And the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all things in the world, and for which all the reſt ſeem to have been made, ſhall never arrive to its end, but ſhall appear as if it were purpoſely framed to be tormented continually with the diſpair of never being able to reach it's injoyment. In which reſpect that of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:119039:77"/> to a Miſer, will be as applicable to every man;
<q>
                     <l>Tantalus a labris ſitiens fugientia captat</l>
                     <l>Flumina: quid rides? mutato nomine de te</l>

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall proceed yet ſomething further. The deſires which men have are of two ſorts; Of which the firſt are conformable to Nature, and do nothing at all encounter reaſon. The ſecond are extravagant and repugnant thereunto; As if a man ſhould deſire to be all ſpirit, and to have no Body at all: this were an extravagance, to which right reaſon cannot aſſent. For tis to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not onely a thing which will not, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe which cannot be, being involved in a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt contradiction, in as much as a man cannot be a man without having a body, nor have a body and be all ſpirit together. And if he ſhould deſire to be metamorphis'd into the nature of thoſe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Intelligences, which we commonly called An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and are not deſtinated to be conjoyned to Bodies, his wiſh would not be leſs abſurd. Becauſe in caſe he ſhould become ſuch a ſimple and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Intelligence, he were no longer the ſame perſon, but ſhould in effect deſire the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own being: for that in tranſmutations wherein the form it ſelf of the thing (as they ſpeak) periſhes, the thing periſhes alſo: Whence it would concern him as little to be an Angel as to be a Dog, and to deſire one as the other. It is not from ſuch deſires as theſe that we are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce arguments to ſhew what is the nature of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119039:78"/> man and of his Soul; becauſe they which make them, deviate from the rules of Nature. The other ſort of wiſhes, which are ſuggeſted by her, and are not thwarted or checked by reaſon, which, I ſay, do not deſtroy the form of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ennoble and advance it, are they which ought to be taken for manifeſt <hi>indices</hi> either of what we naturally are, or at leaſt of what we ought to be. For whence ſhould thoſe deſires happen to us, if they be not inſpir'd by Nature? And to what end ſhould they have been placed in us, if that of which we received of them, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended to give us the ſatisfaction and injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they aim at. Admitting it were poſſible for us to compaſs all thoſe things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make up the ſupream Good of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and that we were in full poſſeſſion thereof; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that natural deſire of the ſupreme Good which might ſeem to be contented in the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there would be left another not leſs vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or leſs inrooted in us, which is that of the perpetuity of ſuch felicity without any alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or interruption whatſoever. Now when we ſhould with all imaginable care have cemented the parts together that compoſe it, when we ſhould have nailed, linked and inveſted them ſo that there would be nothing but death able to diſſolve the junctures, yet it would laſt but for our Life, &amp; our Life could not laſt to the end of an Age. And then what would become of thoſe deſires of injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame for millions of years even to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity?</p>
               <p>But ſome may here arreſt my courſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand whether experience ſhows not that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119039:78"/> to obtain a beatitude durable for ever? For who is he that is exempted from Death? Wherefore ſince wiſe perſons do not onely not conſult about things abſolutely impoſſible, but do not ſo much as deſire them; or if they happen to let a wiſh eſcape from them by ſome ſuddain impetus of nature, they preſently bring the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of reaſon to repreſs it; it follows neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, that ſuch deſire of a perpetual felicity is out of the limits of reaſon, and by conſequence ought to be check'd by it, rather then cheriſh'd and encouraged. For death which happens univerſally, without priviledge to any, renders not the injoyment of a perpetual Good more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to all men, then the weaknes of our minds, the inclination which we have naturally to vice, and the infinite multitude of inevitable miſeries attending humane condition, renders impoſſible the poſſeſſion of the Happineſs which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes and terminates within the duration of our Lives. And nevertheleſs none ever condemned that deſire in man of his felicity, none ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it but both natural and reaſonable. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is manifeſt that all the World deſires Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and the things which we have already deduced, demonſtrate the ſame. Yet there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any perſon that attain'd it. Muſt it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be concluded that the deſire of it is abſurd, and beſides the rules of reaſon and Nature? <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> himſelf did not account it ſo, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the gripings of the Stone, and upon the very confines of death, comforts himſelf with the immortal glory which his Philoſophical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations had acquired and ſhould preſerve for
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119039:79"/> him to perpetuity. <hi>Cicero</hi> profeſſeth Death is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to them who leave nothing of themſelves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter departure out of this life, but not to thoſe whoſe praiſes cannot dye. <hi>Alexander</hi> eſteemed <hi>Achilles</hi> happy in that he had <hi>Homer</hi> to celebrate his Virtues and high atchievments of Armes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his memory would remain conſecrated to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in the Poem of the <hi>Iliads.</hi> And himſelf made profeſſion, that he did not at all fear death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he beliv'd his victories would render him immortal. And not ſo much but <hi>Ennius</hi> the Poet, preſag'd he ſhould live for ever in the mouthes and memories of men by means of his Verſes. <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> promiſe themſelves nothing leſs from their Works, then that they ſhall continue their names throughout all ſucceſſions of time, ſpeaking of them as trophies erected to exempt them from the Power of the Fatal Siſters. Such as cannot hope the ſame from their works or great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, expect at leaſt to ſurvive in their children; and would be very effectually comforted againſt death, if they could be aſſured that by help of their Pictures or Front of their Houſes, their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould retain the remembrance of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances from age to age. Therefore as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of obtaining from this Life, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good deſcribed by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> do's not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but that man was framed by nature to poſſeſs it; and as the impoſſibility of obtaining immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality do's as little evince that man was not deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by nature her ſelf to an incorruptible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; ſo this impoſſibility of obtaining, as we deſire, the perpetuity of the Supreme Good, does not argue that we were not made to injoy
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119039:79"/> it, by him to whoſe power and goodneſs we are indebted for our Original. It muſt follow then, that either thoſe natural deſires which are not at all thwarted by reaſon, were given us to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at all (which is a concluſion that true Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy diſdaines to own) or that there is a ſupreme Felicity which is of perpetual duration. Now the injoyment of that immutable Happineſs is the compenſation allotted to Virtue by the Divine Goodneſs; as the privation thereof is the retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution and penaltie conſtituted by Divine Juſtice to Vice. The cauſe of the whole miſtake, is the ignorance of what we were in beginning, and what we are become ſince by our own fault: for at our firſt creation we were conſtituted in full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of that Felicity, of which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied ſome kind of Idea; but Sin hath diſpoſſeſs'd us of it. The Soul and the Body were both created to Immortality; but the Body is become mortal by our revolt; Both of them were deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to durable Happineſs without diminution or interruption throughout all Ages; but diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience hath ſeparated both the one and the other from it. The Privation of that bliſſeful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is an effect of the Juſtice of God; but the Hope that God hath by his Truth given us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, is an effect of his Mercy; and both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable teſtimonies of his Providence, in as much as they are the moſt remarable inſtances and parts of it. For although God takes upon himſelf the care of Governing the motions of the Heavens, though he orders all the mutations of the Elements, and their mixtures for production of all things in Nature; and though he afford
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119039:80"/> daily ſupply of ſuſtenance neceſſary to the Fiſh of the Sea, the Beaſts of the Field and ths Fowles of the Air; and all this moſt manifeſtly beſpeaks his Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs; yet there is not in all this conduct any thing ſo worthy of himſelf as the exerciſe of his Juſtice in puniſhing, and the works of his clemency in reſcuing thoſe from condemnation which deſerve it. In as much as in the former inſtance he uſes goodneſs towards creatures which have not offended him, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his natural inclinations, and the inviolable relation which is between Him and Them. But in puniſhing, he is inforced to commit a kind of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence (as I may ſo ſpeak) to retain the effects of his Benignity, and to inflict thoſe of his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation out of the onely conſideration of his Juſtice. And when he comes to pardon, his Goodneſs, as it were overflows of it ſelf to ſwallow up his Juſtice in Mercy. Now although I have been ſomewhat more prolixe in this diſpute, and principally in the deduction of theſe laſt particulars, being lead to it by regard of their importance; yet I conceive I have not been te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to the Reader, who underſtands how fruitful and thriving that Doctrine of <hi>Epicurus</hi> is, and with how much obſtinacy and opiniaſtry his ſucceſſors of the preſent time labor to defend it. I omit to meddle with thoſe ſentiments of theirs that purely relate to Natural Philoſophy: wherein the Glory of God, and Piety, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are not ſo neerly and particularly concern'd. Though I muſt not diſſemble, that it is to be fear'd that ſome of thoſe which ſo much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Phyſicks of that Sect, do it chiefly to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119039:80"/> prepare ſome good impreſſion for their Theology and Morality. I ſhall onely add in reference to ſuch as openly declare themſelves for <hi>Epicurus</hi> in that which belongs to Religion, that they have a very high opinion of the ſtrength and ſubtilty of their wits, and bring a great obſtinacy to the defence of their Tenets. For which reaſons it was neceſſary to diſcuſs their ſubterfuges exactly, either to reduce them to a better mind, which I confeſs cannot be done but by the ſole grace of God, or to make them hold their peace, if they have not altogether with piety abandon'd all ſhame. And this I believe, I have performed in ſuch a manner, that no man ought hereafter to be ſcandalis'd if they eſteem the profeſſion of all Religions indifferent. For ſince, to ſpeak plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have no Religion at all in their Heart, it is no great matter to them what it is which they carry in their Lips. I ſhall therefore orderly paſs over to examination of the Opinion deſigned to the ſecond Part of my Work.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S all the World conſents in this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truth, That there is a God (which the <hi>Epicureans</hi> themſelves dare not deny) and likewiſe that God governs all the tranſactions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; (ſince the number of thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119039:82"/> it is inconſiderable in compariſon of its aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and they which profeſs to indubitate the ſame, are conſtrained, as we have formerly ſhown, to confeſs that they have no other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God but by the traces and inſtances of his Providence) So we may obſerve an univerſal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of Nature in this that all Nations have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it neceſſary to the rendring to God the honor belonging to him, that there be one certain determinate form of Conſtitution called Religion, containing the rules according to which men ought to guide and comport themſelves therein. For never was there any Nation that thought it enough to ſerve God in thought onely, without making demonſtration of their devotion by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, &amp; external actions, and obſervation of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ceremonies; unleſs, perhaps, ſome one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe where Barbariſm rules all, and which in that reſpect we uſually term Savages. But the actions of ſuch people are not to be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſequence, except we account it alſo an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent matter to live on humane fleſh as they do, and to be ignorant of all things that are honeſt and worthy recommendation. And yet there will be ſound very few people but have at leaſt ſome ſhadow of Religion, even amongſt the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals.</hi> Now that ſuch Inſtinct of Nature is not brutiſh, but is either accompanied with or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded from reaſon, is no hard matter to make appear with irrefragable evidence. Man is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a Lover of Society, and was not created to live in ſolitude: they which ſo affections to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce converſe with other men, muſt be (as One ſaid long ſince) either ſome thing more or
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119039:82"/> ſome thing leſs then Men. Now we have for the principal objects of our affections, God, and Men like our ſelves; which are alſo the two chief, and perhaps onely things to which we owe any Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Concerning thoſe duties, in which we ſtand obliged one towards another, it hath been requiſite to eſtabliſh certain Societies upon good conſtitutions as upon firm baſes, to the end there might be certain Laws to regulate thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to correct our exceſſes, amend our defaults, reſtrain the licentiouſneſs of ſome, and excite the ſupinity and negligence of others; that by ſuch means all things might be preſerved in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And nature her ſelf firſt gave the model thereof in families, where Parents and Children are held in reciprocal obligations, and ſo bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren one towards another, and likewiſe ſervants themſelves. For from that Pattern were Cities firſt formed, which are as great Families, and Kingdomes which are as great Cities; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as a Family is like a ſmall City, or a narrow Kingdom. And he that ſequeſters himſelf from humane Society to live by himſelf, is look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as an Enemy of Mankind, as <hi>Timon</hi> the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> was; a ſort of Monſter wonderfully rare in the World. As for the Duties incumbent upon us towards the Deity, men have likewiſe appeared ſociable therein, and have not choſen to ſerve God a part by themſelves; but have conſtituted an other kind of Society, in which they might ſerve him all in common, and in ſome ſort par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the devotions one of another; and this according to certain ſacred conſtitutions, ſerving to regulate the mind of man, and to bind every
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:119039:83"/> one in conſcience. So that in this Society, yet much more then in the other, whoſoever ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated himſelf from it, ha's been by common judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the reſt held for an enemy of the Deity, and as a beaſt unworthy to live upon the face of the Earth. And that this is ſo, experience and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Truth atteſts beyond all contradiction.</p>
               <p>But behold the pretenſion to juſtifie their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; Namely, that men are ſo obliged to follow one determined and ſetled conſtitution, that it is not free for them to diſcede to others, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions are preſented to do ſo. For there are ſome that grant it natural to men to have ſome communion in Religion; but they judge that ſuch communion depends on the Pleaſure of each reſpective Nation, being an indifferent thing in it ſelf. They conceive likewiſe that the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religions hath for the moſt part been a contrivance of cunning perſons, whoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of power to keep m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n in ſufficient ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the conſideration of civil Society, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd them to invent another of Religion, by means of which becauſe of the opinion of the Deity, to which men aſcribe a ſoveraign autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and without reſervation, they might hold the minds of their fellow-Citizens in greater awe, and govern them better according to their fancy. Thus you ſee why they are not ſo pervicacious as to ſeparate themſelves wholly from ſuch a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, but communicate willingly in the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ceremonies of their own Country, for fear of imbroiling the World, and to avoid ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which hath been always declined by rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall and intelligent perſons: but otherwiſe they
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:119039:83"/> account it lawful for a man to comply with the places where he happens to be, according to the Adage,
<q>Si fueris Roms, Romano vivito more.</q> Which they back with this reaſon, that Nature indeed inclines men to ſuch a Society, but that God himſelf having not determin'd the form thereof, hath left the ſame to the will of them which govern Commonwealths. Now were not this Opinion profeſs'd and owned by men which are otherwiſe very intelligent, it needed not to be lookt upon but with contempt. For the ſlight eſteem which might be had of its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, together with the invincible oppoſition all Nations bring againſt it, would ſecure it from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king impreſſion on the mind of any one, and ſo it would dy and bury it ſelf. But being that for many years there have been perſons eſteemed highly for their profound knowledge, or their great prudence in management of the affairs of the world, or ſome other commendable qualities of the mind, who have maintain'd or favour'd it; and that in theſe days in which Profaneneſs is overflown, there are many lead by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of men of great reputation; I find my ſelf oblig'd to incounter it vigorouſly, as far as the deſign of this work will permit me.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, it ſeems to me exceeding ſtrange, that theſe men ſhould be more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in that which concerns the Laws of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Society, in which we perform our duties to the Deity, then they are in Civil Life, where
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119039:84"/> they make no queſtion concerning the offices which men owe mutually to one another. For put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the caſe that God hath made no particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his will thereupon (although we ſhall ſee in the ſequel of this diſcourſe that it is not ſo) yet as in Civil Society there are certain natural Laws which are equally and perpetually inviol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſo there are likewiſe ſome in Religion. For example; Whoſoever ſhould come into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth fram'd according to the Idea of that of <hi>Plato,</hi> that is, wherein a community of women were enacted; or in which theſt were publickly eſtabliſhed, as in the Iſland <hi>De los Ladrones;</hi> it would not be fitting for that man to frequent the beds of all ſorts of women, and abandon his own wife upon his firſt coming; the Laws of reaſon and natural honeſty being repugnant thereunto; nor to robbe his neighbor of his purſe when he found him abroad from his houſe. It would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him to ſay to the Magiſtrate as <hi>Antigonus</hi> did to <hi>Creon</hi> in <hi>Sophocles;</hi>

                  </q> No more lawful would it be for a perſon pious towards the Deity to participate in a Religion wherein there were impious and blaſphemous ceremonies, although they which eſtabliſhed them did not think them ſuch. If a man ſhould happen to come into a place where they pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd the Deity with the belly of a Swine and eyes of a Dog, were it meet to adore him under
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:119039:84"/> that figure? Or is it free for thoſe which travel to the Eaſt Indies to mingle themſelves in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties of the Pagans towards their Pagods, and to bear a part in the adorations and ſervices which they render to Devils? Certainly, I do not conceive an honeſt man can conſent ſo much as with one twinkle of his eye to ſuch abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cuſtomes. And truly it was with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that <hi>Tacitus</hi> held the Jews in that deteſtation which he diſcovers in his writings, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that they worſhip'd the Head of an Aſs. But in this he was very much blamable, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe a grand perſonage, and who by his profeſſion of being an Hiſtorian was oblig'd to impart to others the knowledge of the truth of things, he was ſo ill inform'd in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that he ought not to have grounded ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a cenſure upon ſo ſlight a rumor. But that there have been Religions in former times, wherein ſuch abominations were committed, is too manifeſt from Hiſtory: and the Relations brought us from the Eaſt and Weſt parts of the World, give us preſent teſtimonies of the like. Wherefore they againſt whom I now diſpute ought at leaſt to allow as much ſtrictneſs in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ſervice of God, as to the Duties which they render to men. That is, they ſhould readily conform themſelves to ſuch ceremonies as are conſentaneous to right reaſon, or at leaſt not manifeſtly diſſonant and repugnant to it; but where they violate the Laws of Nature ſo rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is not free for any one whatſoever to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to them.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:119039:85"/>
               <p>But the matter is ſomething further conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For it alſo ſeems not to be more natural to men to conſpire together uniformly in matter of Religion, then it is natural to them to think that it is the part of God to found and give the model of ſuch a Society. All Nations have referred the invention of things to the Deity, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they concern not God at all, yet ſeem hard and admirable; ſo as to eſteem the firſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them not onely inſpired by God, but worthy to be Gods themſelves. The Art of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging War, thoſe of Phyſick, and Poetry, and even of Embroidery had their inventors and patrons amongſt the Gods. And as for things neceſſary to Life, the tilling of the Earth for the advantage of Corn, and the means of pruning the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of vines to procure wine from them, were not found by men without the ſame help. It is true that if onely the meaner and ignorant ſort of people had been imbued with this belief, it might have been ſaid that their ignorance occaſion'd the admiration which they had of all excellent inventions; becauſe perceiving that they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd the power of their own wits, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring others by themſelves, they might have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agin'd that men could not have invented them of themſelves. And hence it alſo came to paſs that the <hi>Epicureans</hi> have within a ſmall degree placed their Maſter amongſt the Gods; becauſe being for the moſt part but little inſtructed in commendable Sciences, when they beheld him far above them, they conceited that he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Divinity in him; although, without regard to the truth or falſity of his ſentiments, he ſeems
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:119039:85"/> to have been but meanly qualified with gifts of the mind or acquiſitions of knowledge. But whereas we obſerve the wiſe and learned to have likewiſe held that opinion, that the firſt Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were illuminated by ſome ray of Divinity, it muſt be confeſſed that it is a natural propenſity in all men, and I know not what kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint by the evidence of truth. <hi>Socrates</hi> being condemned to dy, profeſſeth that it was God that raiſed him up to teach Philoſophy, and to reform the manners of his fellow Citizens by his precepts; and pronounces reſolutely, that though they ſhould open the Priſon doors to him with injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on never to Philoſophiſe more, he would not go forth, but would rather obey God then men. And <hi>Pythagoras</hi> when he had found out an excellent demonſtration in Geometry, went and ſacrific'd a hundred Oxen: for what reaſon, ſaving that he acknowledg'd that God had favour'd him with his aſſiſtance therein? And truely they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on their ſide. I would not ſo much derogate from the dignity of the humane Mind, as to take from it all power of inventing excellent things, and of profound diſquiſition. But there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a Providence of God in what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that he that bears not a great meaſure of obſtinacy in his breaſt will ſuffer himſelf to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that God preſided therein. Sometimes one Nation bears away the glory of Sciences and Arts, ſometimes another; and divers Ages give birth to divers Inventions.</p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119039:87"/> the true God could permit him. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto likewiſe all intelligent men agree, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the Poets, who ſeem to have been the Divines of the Pagans, and the Prieſts of their Myſteries. Now whereas they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that humane Arts and Sciences, could not be invented without God, what would they have ſaid of the Sciences of knowing and ſerving God himſelf? But although there may have been ſome diſſonance of opinion among the Ancients concerning this Production or Birth of things; yet the foundation of theſe two kinds of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Civil and Religious, ha's been conſider'd by them as a thing altogether divine. Whence it is, that there never was any celebrated Legiſlator, but made mention of the Deity in the beginning of his Laws, as having received them in ſome ſort by his inſpiration, and ſo conciliated reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to them from that ſuprem authority. And we find that all of them were generally believed by their ſubjects therein; although Political Laws are drawn from principles of Honeſty and Equity derived from thoſe wherwith nature hath imbued the minds of men: So univerſal and deep ha's the perſwaſion been, that ſuch things as are commendable onely for ſpeculation or are bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially practis'd, or difficultly found out and digeſted in beſeeming order, are deriv'd from Heaven, as their primary ſource. And concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion, it is likely never any Nation would have reverenced each their own reſpective ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of Religion, unleſs they had eſteem'd them to have proceeded from Divine Revelation. For not to mention the Jewiſh people at preſent,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119039:87"/> who boaſted thereof heretofore, nor the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who glory therein now with a juſt title, and prove it by irrefutable demonſtrations; can it be imagin'd <hi>Mahomet</hi> would ever have found ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Followers, unleſs he had pretended to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Commiſſion from God, and that the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had given him inſtructions of ſuch things as he ought to do by the information of a Pigeon? Are not we told that to that purpoſe he publiſh'd his <hi>Alcoran</hi> which he perſwaded his Diſciples was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to him from Heaven? It is not credible that ſo ridiculous a Law ſhould be harbor'd in the minds of men ſo obſtinately againſt all the attempts to ſuppreſs it by the Truth, were it not fixed by theſe kind of roots. As for the Pagans, <hi>Nums Pompilius,</hi> who eſtabliſh'd the ceremonies of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> pretended to have been taught them by the Goddeſs <hi>Aegeria;</hi> and in general, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have reſpectively attributed the origine of their Myſteries to their Gods. They were in truth, all of them miſtaken; but yet their belief was founded on this reaſon, that none can either ſpeak or think aright of God, much leſs ſerve him as is meet, unleſs he be taught by God himſelf; as it is impoſſible for creatures deſtitute of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to pay him what is due to him, and contrive the ways of honoring him, like men. But as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Horſes are incapable of inventing the rules of their management, and yet are reduc'd to a regular obſervance of them by exerciſe; ſo Men not being able to attain ſo high as to find out the means of forming their ſouls to Piety, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they can comprehend the ſame when they are revealed to them. But here I meet with
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119039:88"/> an objection laid in our way; Does it not appear, ſay they againſt whom we diſpute, that Religions have been invented by ſubtle and politick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to obtain a more abſolute empire over the minds of others? For who can believe that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> was really inſpir'd by God, unleſs he be as great an Ignorant as that Impoſtor was? or that <hi>Numa</hi> had communication with a Goddeſs? And truely I do not gainſay, but there have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rulers that have made advantage of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to abuſe the credulity of their people. Nor will I ſay that all thoſe which boaſted of revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have had correſpondence with God, &amp; inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from him in reference to the ordaining and eſtabliſhing matters pertaining to his ſervice. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I avouch men have been lead to believe it by the natural inſtinct of judging that Religion could not be given ſaving by the hand of God himſelf. And it is not difficult to render the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on which it is grounded. Every Religion, whether good or bad, conſiſts of two parts; In one of which are contained the laws of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which is due to God; In the other, the means whereby the needs of mens ſouls are provided for, and how to infuſe conſolation and hope into them. But if one ceremony include both theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars together, ſo that both the Deity is honored and conſolation procured to the ſoul of man; ſuch ceremony, although it be but one, yet it ceaſeth not to comprehend both thoſe reſpects, and appears (as I may ſo ſpeak) with both thoſe two countenances. Now in reference to that which concerns the Deity, it hath been already declared that we live beſet with too thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119039:88"/> to be able to know him of our ſelves; and we ſhall make it more amply manifeſt hereafter. Touching the Wants of man, being every one's heart dictates to him that he hath deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his offences, his conſolation can conſiſt onely in the aſſurance of remiſſion: but we are as much or more ignorant of the true means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, then we are in the knowledge of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Whence it hath proceeded that all Nations have been ſo obnoxious to the frauds of Deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who could never have found any credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, had they not been favor'd by thoſe inclinations and ſentiments which naturally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs us. For there is in all ſouls not abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated unto brutiſhneſs an extreme avidity of knowing the Deity, and eſpecially a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of their ſins, with a lively apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of puniſhment and vengeance, and a deſpair of ever being able of themſelves either to find out the means of comforting the conſcience or of ſounding the bottom of that infinite abyſſe. Whence the firſt of thoſe that declared any thing concerning the Deity, and the means of making propitiation for ſins, if men had never ſo little an opinion that thoſe teachers were excited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by God, and they were able to ſtamp the leaſt impreſſion thereof in their minds, they ſoon gather'd a great ſtock of credit in the world. As they who are ſick of ſome deſperate diſeaſe, and which is inexpugnable by ordinary remedies, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily yield themſelves up to the cozenage of Empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, who make boaſt of great ſecrets unknown to all men beſides. Or as they who are poſſeſs'd with a violent paſſion for the Philoſophers Stone
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119039:89"/> although otherwiſe perhaps intelligent enough, leave themſelves open to the firſt impoſtor that promiſes them kingdomes and worlds.</p>
               <p>Hereunto our Adverſaries uſually object two things: Firſt they ſay, if men cannot of themſelves found a good Religion without particular reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from Heaven, it is impoſſible for them to ſerve God aright, if he have not made ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his will: which if he hath done, 'tis a wonder how there come to be ſo few people that inquire after it or receive it. Secondly, wheras nature hath provided a ſupply of all things that are neceſſary to other creatures, it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that ſhe hath neglected man, and left him in utter privation of the principal thing he ha's need of, and without the knowledge and uſe of which he cannot but be miſerable; in which regard ſhe would have been a mother one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to other Animals, and to man, the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of all, a cruel malevolent Stepdame. But it is no great buſineſs to ſatisfie theſe complaints, and we ſhall begin with the laſt. Did we in the other things of Nature behold ſuch order as is competent to their perfection, there would be a juſt occaſion of complaint that ſhe had ſtrangely forgot her ſelf in the particular we have in hand. For ſhe would have produc'd man indued with an excellent faculty of underſtanding, without giving him any knowledge of the End or of the means deſtinated to lead him thereunto; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, whereas all other things ſeem prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned to a certain end, man alone ſhould have been brought into the world inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſcharge all his actions at randome, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:119039:89"/> permit his natural appetites to run unguidedly at a venture. Which were unworthy of that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which we all acknowledge extremely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in divers things in the world of much leſs importance. But who is there that do's not obſerve a lamentable irregularity in Nature? Sometimes the ſeaſons fall out prepoſterouſly and intricately: Sometimes vermin devours the buds of the Trees of the field: ſometimes the air is vitiated in ſuch manner that it begets fatal peſtilences; ſometimes the Sea breaks in upon a Country and ſwallows it up with its inhabitants; and ſometimes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place the inundation of a River drowns great and flouriſhing Cities. What wonder is it therefore, that diſorder, being diffus'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world, ſhould alſo be found in the condition of one of its principal pieces. 'Tis true, will ſome of them reply, but have not theſe things their natural cauſes? Surely, yes; but 'tis as diſeaſes have theirs. For a Fever is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inflammation of the ſpirits and humors, and the humors are not inflam'd except they have had ſome propenſity to be ſo, either by reaſon of their corruption, or their abundance, or from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſome violent external cauſe. Now theſe cauſes which are here called natural, had never been, if there had not been a diſorder in the nature of the bodies themſelves. But thoſe irregularities in particular things are proceeded from the diſorder of their nature in general. As therefore, if the nature of humane bodies had continued in its integrity, a perfect and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble healthfulneſs would have had its natural cauſe in an exquiſite temperature of pure humors; ſo
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119039:90"/> in the diſorder which hath befaln it, diſeaſes have their natural cauſe in the abundance or deficiency, corruption or diſtemperature of the humors alſo. Now all the world is like one Body, of which all the parts, had no change be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen it, would have been diſpoſed in ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent an harmony, that the accidents we mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed could never have happened, which are like diſeaſes ſurpriſing one or other of its members. And therefore as in Nature well regulated, ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, an uniform ſucceſſion of the ſeaſons, and a good conſtitution of the aer would have had their natural cauſes in the perfect harmony of the Whole; So the diſturbances which have ſuceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have theirs alſo in its diſcord and diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But above all things whatſoever, that diſorder is apparent in man, not only in the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which befall him more frequent and great then to any of the reſt of the Creatures; from which it may ſeem Providence ought to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd him: but chiefly in himſelf, in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the perturbations of his mind, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy and conteſt of his Appetites againſt his Underſtanding, and in the darkneſs and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his Underſtanding it ſelf. And this ha's been the ſubject of high complaints in all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

               <p>Therfore to expect that Nature ſhould now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame effects in man, which ſhe would have done in her integrity, is as if one ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of a blind man to walk as directly as when he had good eyes; or of a mad man to have ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thoughts and agreeable to reaſon. Indeed, that which we affirm, that a particular revelation for ordaining the means of ſerving God, and for providing for the needs of man's ſoul, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, is not to be referr'd to nature in its integrity, who perhaps would have furniſh'd us ſufficiently wherewith to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed our duty and comforted our ſelves. Like as a man that is both healthful, diſcreet and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, is capable enough to preſerve himſelf from things which may be hurtful to him; but when he is ſurpris'd with a diſeaſe, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors of a Fever perturbe his Fancy, he wants the aſſiſtance of another to preſcribe him Phyſick, and rules for his recovery.</p>
               <p>And the ſecond difficulty is reſolv'd with the ſame facility. The greateſt part of men imagine that the Religion of which they make profeſſion is true; and are ſo far from taking pains to ſeek out any other, that on the contrary, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties are preſented to them, they reject the ſame without further examination; being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with this prejudice againſt them, that ſince
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119039:91"/> they have for a long while been owners of the truth, any other novelty cannot be but an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture. And this is uſually ſtrengthened by the natural affection which we have towards the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions and uſes of our own country, and the conſtitutions under which we have been educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from our infancy. For not onely the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains &amp; rivers &amp; fields of our own Country have a kind of pleaſingneſs &amp; attraction which allures our minds, but alſo the manners of the inhabitants and the cuſtomes practis'd amongſt them. And it is no great wonder if we eaſily deceive our ſelves in ſuch things. For the ſame imbecillity of our Underſtandings which hinders us from finding out the true Religion of our ſelves, does likewiſe hinder us from judging ſo ſincerely and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we ought, of ſuch things as are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us. Beſides that the opinions wherewith We are already imbued, are a greater hindrance to us in this matter, then if we were ignorant of all Religions; becauſe it is requiſite that we firſt unlearn what we conceive we already know for certain; which is a very difficult thing: as Wool which ha's received ſome tincture beforehand, is leſs fit to be dy'd into pure and native colours, then that which is altogether crude. As for thoſe whoſe happier Underſtandings have enabled them to perceive the vanity of falſe Religions, and yet have not been inſtituted in the true, 'twas the diſpair of being able to diſcover it, which made them give over the inquiry; as if a man that had experienc'd the weakneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs of the Balm of Empiricks, ſhould utterly deſpair of Phyſick, and abandon the care
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:119039:91"/> of dreſſing his ulcer together with the hope of healing it. And if <hi>Diagoras</hi> &amp; <hi>Euemerus,</hi> two perſons branded by the Ancients with the title of Atheiſts ſuffer'd themſelves to be carried to a total &amp; abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute contempt of the Deity, there is great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that it was occaſion'd by the ill opinion which they had of their falſe Gods, and there being at a loſs in finding out the means to ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the true one in their room. But certainly I do not conceive that any other reaſon induc'd <hi>Socrates</hi> to reclaim men from the contemplation of divine and celeſtial things, which had been the principal imployment of the Philoſophers which liv'd before him, to the ſtudy of a Civil Life, and of the Laws of Policy and Virtue, after the vain attempts of his predeceſſors and his own. Whence it came to paſs that he was condemned as a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſer of the Religion of his Country, becauſe he ſaw that all their doctrine of the Gods was erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and their ceremonies, ſuperſtition and vanity; and ſo finding no other Religion which ſatisfied him, he addicted himſelf to things in which the mind of man ſees ſomewhat more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch as is the doctrine of Virtue, and of the Laws upon which Governments are founded. As it is natural to us to take pleaſure in things which are eaſie, and which we underſtand, and to diſeſteem thoſe which are high and which we perceive are too remote for us to attain. But all this is not ſufficient, unleſs we ſhew by evident reaſons that the particular declaration of the will of God in this point is abſolutely neceſſary. Which ſhall be my undertaking in the enſuing Chapters.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> How greatly it imports true piety, That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man be throughly aſſured that his Religion is Good; And, that that cannot be, unleſs it be of Divine Revelation.</head>
               <p>ALthough there be certain verities in Religion ſo evident, that the greateſt part of mankind aſſents to them unanimouſly; as, that there is a God; &amp;, That he ought to be honored; That men are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to live agreeably to Reaſon and Nature; and, That the Deity which commands it ſo, rewards the obſervation of that commandment, and puniſhes thoſe ſeverely which tranſgreſs it: yet as to the manner of ſerving God aright, and alſo of living conſentaneouſly to Nature and Reaſon, there ha's been alwayes a thouſand differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who of their own motion have gone about to teach it to others. For ſcarce can there be found any Commonwealth among thoſe which have been eſteemed the beſt polici'd, in which ſome grand and ſignal vice ha's not been excuſed or permitted, or even ſometimes recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by publike Laws. But though they had accorded much better in the deſcription of the duties incumbent on men one towards another; as it cannot be denied but that they have leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed therein then in that which pertains to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; there is no perſon ſo meanly verſed in the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:119039:92"/> hiſtory of the Pagans ceremonies in matter of Religion, but obſerves a wonderful ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion about them. For under the name of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, I comprehend not onely the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> although there was a great medley in their myſteries; but I alſo underſtand all other Nations, which either have been heretofore or are ſtill deſtitute of the knowledgè of the true God, in ſeveral parts of the World. And this is not to be marvell'd at. For ſince they have differ'd ſo much concerning the Nature of the Elements, and the principles of the compoſition of things; and have diſputed ſo hotly touching fire, air, and water, things which fall under the notice of Senſe; how was it poſſible they ſhould agree in that, which with common conſent ſurpaſſes all the power and acuteneſs of the mind of man? And in ſo great and almoſt unimaginable confuſion of opinions, what wit had been capable to diſcover and ſift out the truth, if there had been any in them, and to aſſure himſelf certainly that he had found it? In which regard the moſt prudent and moderate amongſt them affirmed, that it was the ſafeſt way not to penetrate too far into things, and that God is a Being improportionably tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending humane comprehenſion. And the ſtory of <hi>Simónides</hi> is too well known to need relating. How then could they know the means of ſerving God as they ought, ſeeing the reverence which we bear towards any thing is naturally meaſur'd according to the knowledge which we have of its nature? So that in the incertainty in which the mind of man fluctuates perpetually without any ſtay or guide, what could the devotion of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:119039:93"/> thoſe be, who could not be ſolidly inſtructed in that knowledge; or what could the zeal of thoſe be towards any Religion who hold all to be of humane inſtitution and indifferent? For there are but two guides in us, under whoſe conduct we are able to compaſs any thing; namely, Reaſon, and Appetite. Reaſon is moved by knowledge of the becommingneſs and profitableneſs of that which is offer'd to it, when it apprehends them in one object conjointly: for right reaſon will never account that profitable which is not honeſt too: but where it perceives honeſty conjoyn'd with apparent utility, it is carried forth towards the ſame without ſcruple. Paſſion is excited to moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by an infinite variety of incentives, of which none can be commendable when they are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reaſon, as hath been very well obſerved by the Philoſophers themſelves. If therefore a man be uncertain whether the Religion he profeſſeth be good and profitable, that is, commendable in it ſelf and congruous to reaſon, and that it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the means of obtaining the favour of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which is the aime all Religions drive at: one of theſe two things will neceſſarily happen; either he will be very coldly affected towards it, or in caſe he be carried to it with zeal, it will be but a vehemence of Paſſion in his mind deſtitute of the guidance of reaſon, without which a man can do nothing worthy of commendation. For if Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion principally move him to it, the incertainty of the Nature of his Religion being conſidered with reaſon will keep his affection in ſuſpenſe: and if he be lead on onely by the bent of Paſſion, it will neither be a legitimate affection, nor a juſt and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:119039:93"/> zeal. Now on the one ſide, I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe people make any account of a Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is not but onely in appearance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the heart being affected therewith; ſince they would ſcarce allow their ſlaves to owe them ſuch a kind of ſervice; and on the other, that there is no appearance that they think the Deity accepts the worſhip which is performed by a blind paſſion and deſtitute of all rule and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>It is indeed true that I meet with ſome, even among them which we are the name of Chriſtians, who are of opinion that God look't with a favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eye upon the devotion in which all Nations pretended heretofore to ſerve him in ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent forms; and that even their piety, although blind and dark, in that profound ignorance wherein they liv'd, was oftentimes followed with the benedictions of Heaven. But herein they do not concur with the principal Miniſters of the Author of Chriſtian Religion, who tell us that all devotion of the Pagans was a ſervice per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to Divels. And as for the number of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which the Pagans received from Heaven, they were not conferr'd on them upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their ceremonies, which were rather impieties and deteſtable abominations then Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but proceeded meerly from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God's being God, namely as he is good, and do's not ceaſe, notwithſtanding any ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of men towards him, to do good to them, as being naturally inclinable ſo to do, and a lover of the race of mankind. But whereas his purpoſe was to invite them to him by his benedictions, as
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:119039:94"/> ſoon as they had received them, they went to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thanks to Devils or certain Chimera's of Deities which themſelves had inveſted with Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But if he ſeems to have gratified ſome few more particularly, among whom there appear'd a greater meaſure of devotion, as he favoured the <hi>Romans</hi> with numerous victories and other great advantages, which rais'd their Empire to ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd a grandeur; they were ordinarily rather judgements executed upon other Nations, then teſtimonies of the favour of God towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of <hi>Rome.</hi> For it is certain, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets themſelves foretold the ſame, that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly purpoſed to render that State potent and terrible, as if he would give a fierce and voraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beaſt teeth of Iron to deſtroy all that came in its way, to the end that by devouring other Nations as it did, it might execute the divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon them, yet without underſtanding the ſecret end ſuch actions tended to. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I know not how the <hi>Roman</hi> Armes could be acceptable to him by reaſon of their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were all abominations, ſince there is no appearance they could be ſo for their juſtice; For as the Pirate of old ſaid to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that himſelf was called a Pirate becauſe he rob'd on the ſea with a Shallop, but <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſtyled a Great King, though he practis'd the ſame trade, becauſe he had a Fleet of five hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſail; the ſame reproach may with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be applyed to the <hi>Romans.</hi> What difference was there between them and Theeves or Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſaving that theſe cannot pillage but ſome few perſons they meet with travelling in Woods, or
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119039:94"/> ſome remote houſes in Forreſts, and they plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Kings and Kingdoms? Who ſold that vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond <hi>Romulus</hi> the juriſdictions of the Potentates of all the world, to tranſmit the ſame to his Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendants? There is then leſs reaſon to think that God took pleaſure in their ſuperſtitions, which were inept and ridiculous, though they had had no reference to Devils. Can it be believed (for example) that God puniſh'd a <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul with an overthrow of his Army, becauſe he had deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed the Augury they us'd to take from young chickens, who did not devour the food caſt to them greedily enough? Or that <hi>Marcus Craſſus</hi> was defeated and ſlain by the <hi>Parthians,</hi> becauſe he had made light account of I know not what imprecations or curſings, which had been made for him by <hi>Caius Atteius?</hi> Certainly there was never in the world a greater contemner of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guries and Preſages, and other ſuch fopperies, then <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> nor yet any Warrier that ever ſucceeded ſo fortunately and gloriouſly in ſo many Battels? For he ſeem'd to have took up a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of trampling upon thoſe ſuperſtitions, and braving his own Gods; and nevertheleſs all this hindred him not from atchieving his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes. It were to have an ill opinion of the Wiſdome of God, to imagine he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the devotions and ceremonies, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſts themſelves deſpiſed in ſo high a degree, that One ſaith in <hi>Cicero,</hi> they had much ado to contain from ſmiling when they met one another in the ſtreets. But if God ſometimes heaped ſome particular favors upon Nations, whoſe Juſtice and Virtue were more
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:119039:95"/> commendable then their devotions, it was to ſhew how grateful true Virtue is to him, ſince he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded ſo graciouſly that which was no more then a ſhadow of it. Which tended to the incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other people, to the imitation of thoſe whom he favoured ſo, becauſe, as I ſaid above, he loves the Society of mankind, and ſuch Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cannot ſubſiſt without men bear at leaſt ſome kind of affection to that which hath the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Virtue and Juſtice. But as for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Religions, he was ever ſo far from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any eſteem of them, that he always had an implacable averſion againſt them. It is not my intention here to judge of the favour which he may have ſhewn towards ſome in his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. For it is in truth moſt certain, that upon judgement of things not according to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance onely, but by the Rules we have in the Word of God and by the Oeconomy he hath follow'd toward all Nations, beſides the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> all the Gentiles were ſubject to a dreadful Curſe. But it ſuffices that it is not my deſign at preſent to inſiſt further upon this point; beſides that it would be a great temerity to limit God in the diſpenſation either of his Wiſdom or his other Perfections, or to pronounce determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately of things which are not revealed to us. I ſhall onely ſay, that it is a thing directly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to truth, reaſon, and Nature, that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Ethnicks ſhould have been grateful to him. For it cannot be concluded that for that many amongſt them were lead with a good zeal to ſuch devotions (by a good zeal I mean the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of being well-pleaſing to the Deity therein)
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:119039:95"/> they therefore performed an acceptable or ſo much as excuſable ſervice to him. The aim and deſign of an action does not render the ſame good or praiſe-worthy, unleſs it be ſo in effect of it ſelf, otherwiſe all things conſidered apart by themſelves would be in a manner of the ſame value, and it would be onely the End that made the difference between them. And becauſe that opinion, That the intention alone is capable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate and put a price upon actions, is a Rock on which I obſerve many fall foul upon, I eſteem it not impertinent to ſpend a few pages in expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the matter.</p>
               <p>There are generally two ſorts of things in which men are deficient either toward God or towards one another. The firſt are thoſe in which men offend when they are tranſported by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their Paſſions, although reaſon either by its own natural inſtinct, or advertiſement by ſome expreſs command of God, makes them hold out for a while. For where Vice ha's not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clouded and ſubverted reaſon (which happens onely to ſuch as God abandons in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner) men do not commit many conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable crimes without reluctancy of conſcience; but at length, after ſome conteſt and encounter, Reaſon becomes captiv'd by the violence of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Now no perſon can on any grounds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count theſe kind of actions excuſable. For ſince the private conſcience of thoſe which perpetrate the ſame, do's not acquit them, how can they be excus'd thereof by others? No queſtion, every one is the moſt favourable judge of his own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But where we are condemned in our own
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:119039:96"/> cenſure of any fault, it would be great folly to expect our abſolution from that of others. And nothing is more abſolutely conformable to the Principles of Nature and Light of Reaſon, then Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> juſtifying the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the judgement which God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce upon the Gentiles at the laſt day, by the condemnation which their own thoughts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce againſt them in their breaſts. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that Paſſion is ſometimes ſo vehement, and obſcures the Underſtanding ſo far, that after the commiſſion of an evil action, attempts are made to defend it, and reaſons ſought out to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour it with the dreſs &amp; appearance of Good and Fit. But this proceeds from the affection which we bear toward our ſelves, and from the obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our paſſions; which yet are of no moment to juſtifie the deed. Otherwiſe the more wicked any one were, the more excuſable would his wickedneſs be; for they are the moſt wicked, who have moſt given themſelves up to the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitous ſwing of their unreaſonable appetites. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it often falls out that an action is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding condemned in the heart, though it be in ſhew defended and excuſed; but men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to appear to others what they know themſelves to be. If Paſſion troubles the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reaſon in any one ſo, as to take from him the knowledge of the vitiouſneſs of his action, there needs onely to give him leaſure till the ſame be ſomewhat appeaſed and to bring him if poſſible to conſult his thoughts with compoſedneſs and ſerenity of mind. For when once the Paſſion hath remited its violence, and gives room for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:119039:96"/> there is ſcarce any man in whom conſcience do's not perform the office of a judge which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be corrupted. If this be not effectual, but particular intereſts keep reaſon abſolutely in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, it is requiſite to ſeparate the man and his fact, and repreſent to him the ſame action which he hath committed, under the name of ſtrange perſons diſguiſing the ſtory a little with ſome ſlight circumſtances, which do not at all concern the ground-work. Thus the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> made uſe of an Apologue to <hi>David,</hi> after his adultery with <hi>Barſheba,</hi> and the murder of her Huſband, to the end he might draw the King wholly from his own intereſts and prejudices which he might have in favor of himſelf. The conſequence of which was, that he brought him to pronounce without heſitation a moſt equitable judgement, which immediately after he obſerved was appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to his own crime. In effect, if a man does not in ſuch caſe pronounce his own condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it muſt be confidently affirmed that Vice is ſo much rooted and incorporated into his mind, that it hath extinguiſh'd all the ſeeds of Honeſty which Nature had ſown in it, and triumphs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely over his conſcience and his reaſon.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort is of thoſe things in which we fail by ſome error of judgement, without being tranſported by our Paſſions, and conſequently without any repugnance of conſcience. In faults of this nature we are ſometimes excuſable, and ſometimes not. As for inſtance; If a man thinking to ridde himſelf of his enemy kills his Father in the darkneſs of the night; the fact conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſtrictly is Parricide; but the ignorance
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:119039:97"/> of him that committed the ſame renders it a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree leſs, and excuſable. Yea it may ſo fall out that his intention may make it commendable; as in caſe he underſtood himſelf to be with an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of his Prince or Country in an alarm, and that he could not poſſibly diſtinguiſh by any token, or ſuſpect by any occaſion or conjecture, that it were his Father. The true character which can manifeſt his purpoſe in the action, is, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, if upon beholding his Father dead, he is diſpleaſed with his misfortune, and affected with a ſenſible regret and ſorrow, and plead nothing in his own favour beſide his total ignorance of the thing, and the falſe appearances which temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to the miſtake. So it may be judged that <hi>Oedipus</hi> was extremely unfortunate, but neither a parricide nor inceſtuous: and that <hi>Thyeſtes</hi> eat the fleſh and dranke the blood of his children, and yet it ought not to be concluded that he was therefore any thing the more unnatural or barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. The pitious lamentations wherewith they both deplor'd their unhappineſs, ſufficiently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak their innocence of thoſe crimes, and that the ſame were befallen them by a pardonable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. One of them cryes out to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in <hi>Seneca,</hi>
                  <q>

                  </q> And thereupon in a furious deſpair tore his eyes out of his Head. But all ignorances are not alike, For there are ſome things we are ignorant of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though we do know them, yet we take pleaſure to delude our ſelves by vain reaſons on purpoſe to obliterate their knowledge out of our minds; like bad ſervants who conſtrue their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters orders to a contrary ſenſe, becauſe they are not according to their humor, and indevor to perſwade their miſinterpretation to others, till at length they are drawn to believe for true what they ſo ſtrongly deſire ſhould be ſo. Thus ſome man that in the commencement of a Law-ſuit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood at firſt that he had the wrong ſide, is by the eagerneſs, ſlights and ſubtleneſs of Barretry ſo perverted from the knowledge of juſtice, that at laſt he takes up an aſſurance that his cauſe is Good. Now is the injuſtice which he commits afterwards in purſuit of ſuch a perſwaſion, any wiſe excuſable by his ignorance? If it be, there is no command but may be ſecurely infringed, when it is free for ſervants to gloſs upon the words of their Maſters: no ſort of in juſtice, which does not become right and equitable; nor fraud but may be converted into ſincere and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proceeding, if it be lawful for a man to blind himſelf with his paſſion, and to perplex the knowledg he hath of Truth in affected difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:119039:98"/> Where there is an abſolute commandment and which proceeds from a ſoveraign authority, ſuch as God's is, we ought to be ſo humble and obedient, as though we ſhould not comprehend all the reaſon of ſuch command, yet the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the perſon that gives it ſupplies what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in the underſtanding of the ſame. And Verity and Juſtice ought to be of ſuch eſteem as where they appear clearly to us, though it be not eaſie to unty all the difficulties which may ariſe, we ought to hold them always notwithſtanding for ſacred and venerable. As on the contrary, that perverſion of Reaſon which is effected by the ſubtilty of cavillations and Sophiſtry inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to abuſe men, ought to be eſteemed an intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Underſtanding. But do we hold him excuſable who being diſturbed with exceſs of wine commits a wrong or an indignity? No, certainly; for ſince he is the cauſe of his own error, his ignorance ought to be imputed to him together with the reſt of the miſchiefs conſequent to it, what intention ſoever he had during the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of his debauchery.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, There are ſome things which we are ignorant of, becauſe we have been too ſupine in ſearching to know them. But if through ſuch ignorance a man commit ſomething againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon, is there any juſt cauſe to acquit him of the fact? No more ſurely then in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the documents of Nature and Reaſon are ſufficiently clear, if diligence be imployed to comprehend them; and in ſuch caſes the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence it ſelf is a crime, every man being oblig'd to be attentive and circumſpect in that which is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:119039:98"/> duty. Now it is not at all reaſonable to excuſe one fault with another, or to judge the duty not incumbent on a man, becauſe he is ignorant of it at ſuch times as he might have known it. So the Pagans were ignorant that the Statues which they erected to the Deity, were a diſparagement to his glory, and thought they well diſcharged the duties of Piety, when they burnt incenſe to him before thoſe Images. It is not doubted but they had a good zeal therein, that is to ſay, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of performing ſomewhat well-pleaſing to the Deity. But yet their Worſhip was no other then deteſtable Idolatry, ſeeing it was poſſible for them to have learn't by contemplation of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe and the Providence which governs it, that God is of an infinite and ſpiritual nature, and which hath no reſemblance with ours. For to ſpeak plainly, they did him as little honor as they would have done to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> if after they had heard wonders related of his Wiſdom, Valor, and other rare qualities, they ſhould have repreſented that great Emperor under the figure of a Beaſt. For if their good intent juſtified them, the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> might have as much to plead for themſelves when they adored God under the likeneſs of irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, yea even of dead and inſenſible creatures. Becauſe the duty of the Conſcience toward the Deity is like that of a Wife towards her Husband, namely, as preciſe and incommunicable to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and to defend the Idolatry of the Pagans with the pretext of a good meaning is as if a man ſhould go about to excuſe a Wife who had amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly entertain'd ſome other perſon in her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands abſence, under colour that ſhe fancied
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:119039:99"/> ſome reſemblance between them, and ſhould not diſſallow that being ſhe could not injoy her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhe was for his ſake much affected towards his image. In a word, in the ignorances of which we are not our ſelves the cauſe, the Action takes it's tincture from the good intention, and is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed accordingly: but in ignorances proceeding either from a manifeſt affectation, or apparent neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to obtain the truths which offer themſelves to the Underſtanding, the intention, how good ſoever it he, follows the nature of the Action; ſo that if the Action be bad, the intention cannot poſſibly be good.</p>
               <p>But to return to our purpoſe; Certainly God is not onely the principal, but the onely object of Religion; ſo that the knowledge of Him is the foundation of all Piety: which if it be ſolid, the ſtructure built upon it will be firm; if bad and faulty, all that is raiſed upon it will fall to ruin. He that pleaſes may read in <hi>Cicero,</hi> the relation which <hi>Velleius</hi> there makes of the opinions of the Philoſophers concerning this matter. I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited ſome of them already, but there are more remaining; for we may find there about four or five and twenty, ready counted; beſides ſeveral which he forgot. <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> alſo affords better ſtore; but they all agree in this particular, that they are in a manner equally falſe, extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and unworthy the name of their Authors, who were generally commendable perſons and of great reputation; Otherwiſe, they are ſtrangly diſcordant in all circumſtances. Yet every one of them conceived he had reaſon on his ſide, and that his fancy was dreſs'd up with rational and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119039:99"/> handſome probabilities and appearances. In which horrible jarring what means is there to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the voice of truth, if it were amongſt them? Who is he of mankind whoſe intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are ſubtle and vers'd enough in this matter, to be able to diſcern her in the midſt of ſuch confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to aſſure himſelf that he hath obſerv'd her by her peculiar characters? But ſurely there is none that bethinks himſelf to find truth in that medly of ſentiments and opinions although his Underſtanding were quicker-ſighted in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then naturally it is: for moſt certainly it is not to be found there; and I dare readily give thoſe againſt whom I diſpute their choice to maintain without bluſhing the moſt tolerable of them all: Except perhaps that of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> who (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the relation of <hi>Cicero</hi>) affirms that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and excellent diſpoſition of all things owes its original to an infinite Underſtanding, but <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> do's not expreſs that he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd whether that Underſtanding were of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite or infinite eſſence. And <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> whoſe diſciple he had been, contented himſelf with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Principle and Element of all things is infinite; leaving it to be conjectur'd whether he meant the Matter thereby, as the Air, or Water (which was the opinion of <hi>Thales</hi>) or ſome other like thing; or rather that which indued the ſame with Form and Order, which <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> termed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But if the opinions of theſe two be put together, it may be <hi>Anaximenes</hi> attributed infinity to the Matter, and <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> added to the ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e an infinite Underſtanding, not onely to frame and diſpoſe it, but alſo to ſerve for its Form. From
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119039:100"/> whence it reſults that the World is an infinite God and yet compoſed too, ſuch as <hi>Pliny</hi> fancyes it in the beginning of his Natural Hiſtory, and <hi>Virgil</hi> deſcribes in the verſes which I here ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn;
<q>
                     <l>Principio coelum ac terram campoſque liquentes</l>
                     <l>Lucentemque globum Lunae Titaniaque aſtra</l>
                     <l>Spiritus intus agit, totamque infuſa per artus</l>
                     <l>Mens agitat molem, &amp; magno ſe corpore miſcet.</l>
                  </q> Now this conceit is implicated with a thouſaud abſurdities &amp; impertinences. And yet Philoſophers of the preſent Age have no cauſe to boaſt that they are naturally more knowing in this particular then their predeceſſors were. All that the ſtrength of the mind of man is able to reach to in reference to the knowledge of the Deity, was attempted in that interval of time which interceded between that wherein Philoſophy began to flouriſh in <hi>Greece</hi> and the declination of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. It was in that period that we experienc'd all our power, and found at the upſhot of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we underſtood nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>How then (will ſome ſay) Are there not inſtances enough in Heaven and Earth &amp; the Government of the world, from whence to extract at leaſt ſome good and ſolid knowledge of God? If there be not, why then are arguments drawn from thence againſt the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> to prove providence to them, and to refute their opinions concerning the nature of God? If there be, why cannot a man make uſe of them, to guide him at leaſt in ſome meaſure to the knowledge of thoſe ſecrets?
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:119039:100"/> God forbid that we ſhould ſo much forget our ſelves, as to forget how clearly God ha's revealed himſelf in the World. The manifeſtation which he hath made therein of his Perfections is one thing, and the faculty which we naturally have to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, an other. Reaſon indeed, but that which is right and in its integrity, not ſuch as we now poſſeſs, might have thence collected the means of ſerving God in a due manner. But as it is deprav'd, blind, and maim'd in its powers and apprehenſions, it is utterly incapable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth therein, or forming certain rules of piety from thence. There is light enough in the Sun to make it be ſeen; but it is by thoſe who have eyes: to theſe who never had any, or have loſt them, it is as dark as the Earth on which they tread. In like manner an infinite number of bright and excellent truths are held forth in the World and its Government, to him that ha's the eye of his Underſtanding ſufficiently clear and ſerene. But the Eye of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which we call Reaſon, in the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we injoy it at preſent, is ſo diſtemper'd, clouded and perturb'd, that it beholds the truths which are there, notwithſtanding all their clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but very obſcurely; and though they are moſt certain and ſtedfaſt in themſelves, yet when it contemplates them, it perceives them onely as if they were inconſtant and wavering. Nor are men in this Age more free from theſe natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments then they were two thouſand years ago, and conſequently can be no better aſſured of their knowledge. For to ſay that 'tis a Science which may aſwell have been improved as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:119039:101"/> they which liv'd ſince having taken from the Opinions of the Ancients what was pure and rejected the unſound and bad, is a thing of no moment to our diſcourſe, becauſe it is untrue. Perhaps <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> built his Philoſophy up with the opinions of Elder Philoſophers, by refining them from that which he found faulty, and ſerving himſelf with the truths before diſcover'd by them, aſwell to employ the ſame as materials to his ſtructure, as to find out others which were yet abſtruſe aad unknown. And indeed it hath been obſerved that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> furniſh'd him with the grounds of his Phyſiology, ſo that he had no more to do but to build upon them; and ſome have moreover believ'd that in divers places of his Writings and particularly in his Epiſtles he ſupplyed him with many ſingular advantages to the compoſing of his Ethicks. And although he refutes <hi>Plato</hi> in ſeveral of his Opinions, yet it is certain that he took many excellent inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both from the diſcourſes which he heard him make in his Academy, and from the reading of his Works. But, I pray, obſerve how this came to paſs. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was indued with an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable to diſcern diſtinctly enough in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Philoſophy, the truths which his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors had brought to light, and diſtinguiſh the ſame from falſities; he was able to cull out and to place ſome apart from others, and ſo to compoſe out of his own inventions and thoſe of others, a Body of Science better contriv'd then any had been before, and whoſe parts were more corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent amongſt themſelves. But here the Queſtion is concerning truths, which the mind
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:119039:101"/> of man, in its preſent eſtate, is not capable to perceive clearly; ſo that if he were put to make his choice of thoſe different Opinions, it would betide him, that inſtead of hapning right, he would rather chooſe the worſt; and thus it hath fallen out to all them which took imperfect hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon for their guide therein; If this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be not ſatisfactory to my Adverſaries, let them pay themſelves with experience. Why did not <hi>Cicero</hi> garble all thoſe different Opinions of Philoſophers touching the Nature of the Gods, to frame a good one if poſſible, and leave poſterity a rational doctrine in ſo important a matter? But in ſtead of doing ſo, the conſciouſneſs of his weakneſs makes him content himſelf with reciting them: and after all his ſtories, he knows as little of it as he did at firſt; as if they had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but clouds and darkneſs caſt before his eyes. Or why do not they ſhow us the writings of ſome Philoſopher either ancient or modern, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no otherwiſe aſſiſted then by the meer light Reaſon, ha's had more ſound and ſober opinions concerning it then his predeceſſors? On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, it will be found that ſome Philoſophers, who heretofore impugned Chriſtian Religion, and the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, and who ought to have purifi'd that doctrine from the old abſurdities it abounds with, to the end their adverſaries might have leſs advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, have been guilty of as many imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences as they of preceding times, and afforded as much cauſe to be inſulted over in regard of the ſtupidity and ridiculouſneſs of their conceits. The unhappineſs is, that being naturally blind in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:119039:102"/> theſe things, we nevertheleſs conceive we ſee clearly; and are ſo poſſeſs'd with a good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſelves, that we will not admit any one to teach us; or if we have been taught by ſome bodyelſe, we are ſo ungrateful that we will not acknowledge it, but reproach and execrate thoſe perſons from whom we have received all the pureſt of our knowledge. For 'tis the ſame caſe with theſe people and the <hi>Epicureans:</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been enlightned by Chriſtian Religion in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truths, in the ignorance or incertitude of which they had otherwiſe eternally ſtagger'd or fluctuated, they arrogate the glory of having of themſelves drawn them out of the bottom of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi>'s Well, or eſtabliſh'd the belief of the ſame amongſt men by the ſtrength of their reaſon. For, why are they not (ſay they) as capable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them, as they are to apprehend and receive them ſince they are revealed? A wonderful Queſtion truly, and worthy of ſuch ſubtle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons! As if there were not a capacity in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of a dozen years old to apprehend the moſt difficult Geometrical Demonſtrations, when they are taught the ſame by ſome ſkillful Maſter; who notwithſtanding could never of themſelves have invented the leaſt Theorem in that Science; Or as if we did not ſee them every day learn the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick</hi> Tongue readily by help of a knowing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor, although they were as well able to pull the Stars out of Heaven (as we ſay) as to have diſentangled the confuſion of that Language and reduc'd it into Grammatical Rules. It is indeed by the ſame faculty of Underſtanding that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd truths are comprehended, and thoſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:119039:102"/> found out which are unknown; but there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a far greater ſtrength and vivacity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect to make new diſcoveries then to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend things which are offered ready framed to our hand. Semblably as the difference is which uſes to be put between the <hi>Intellectus agens</hi> and <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiens;</hi> of which the latter is capable only to receive the Ideas of things arriving to it by the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of objects; whereas the former refines and illuminates them, and purifies them from what they have of terreſtrial or material, that ſo they may become abſolutely worthy of our contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. Since therefore it is demonſtrated that without a ſupernatural revelation, the mind of man can have no certain underſtanding of the nature of God, it is neceſſarily conſequent that without ſuch revelation he is not able to render any acceptable ſervice to him. For if he frame Ideas of God which are unſutable to him, he will not adore God when he deſigns to do ſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe Ideas, but onely a vain Phantaſme of his Imagination. And it cannot be thought, but that in the natural darkneſs of our minds we are unable to frame other conceptions of him then what are infinitely below his excellence, and which attribute nothing to him but ſuch as diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his dignity. But upon a ſtricter inquiry, we ſhall find yet ſomething further. For ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a man were ſo happy as caſually to light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the knowledge of the true God, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty which accompanies ſuch a knowledge of chance, hinders all good and lawful exerciſe of the Religion which he ſo found out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For either the probabilities which adjudge
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:119039:103"/> it good, and the appearances which on the other ſide indubitate it, will be equal in our judgement; or we ſhall eſteem thoſe which induce to believe it bad of greateſt moment; or thoſe moſt rational which incline us to judge favourably thereof. Whence if in the firſt place the mind of man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in ſuſpence, when any religious action is to be performed, whether he ought to do it or not, he will become poiſed between contrary proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and indetermin'd (as they ſpeak) not knowing on which ſide to propend. If he makes any reſolution, it will be wholly to abſtain from the ſame, upon this conſideration, that as in a doubtful caſe whether Wine would be hurtful to a ſick perſon or not, it is better to give him none at all, ſince it cannot be ſo profitable but it may be as noxious; ſo it is better to abſtain from a dubious action in matter of Religion, becauſe being done at a venture, it cannot ſo much pleaſe God in caſe it ſhould be good in it ſelf, but it may equally offend him if it ſhould be bad. And his conſcience will readily flatter him with this thought, that God will take it better from him that he ha's abſtain'd from doing a thing well-pleaſing to him, out of fear to offend him, then if he ſhould offend him by putting it to the chance of performing a thing well-pleaſing to him. For the omiſſion of that which is good, is criminal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but the perpetration of evil is a double guilt, firſt in the commiſſion it ſelf, and next in abſtaining from doing the contrary good. But if he judge the reaſons which diſſwade the thing as bad, to be preponderant, then he will either abſtain from doing it, according as reaſon injoyns
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:119039:103"/> him; or if he commit it, yet, how excellent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſoever it be, it will not be a good action in regard of him, but a crime. For he will have committed a thing with deliberate purpoſe which he judged offenſive to the Deity; which would be no leſs then to trample on all reſpect which we ought to have towards God. And this <hi>Cicero</hi> hath well obſerved in things ſimply moral. For he teaches expreſly, that a good man ought to do nothing contrary to the dictate of his conſcience or judgement, and accounts that to offend <hi>Jupiter</hi> and to go againſt the motion of a man's own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in any thing whatſoever is one and the ſame thing. Laſtly, when the appearances which induce to believe the thing good, ſeem ſomewhat more plauſible and reaſonable then the others, if he be not a profane perſon (whoſe religious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Deity cannot behold with a favorable ey) he will ſcarce be able to guide himſelf therein without being driven by the natural timerouſneſs of his conſcience into irremediable perplexities. For like as when a man hath eaten ſomething which he ſuſpected was poiſonous, if afterwards he happen to feell the leaſt alteration in his body, he is troubled for ſo doing, becauſe the danger wherein he conceives himſelf diſturbs his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and augments his ſuſpicions, quite diſpelling thoſe reaſons which overweighed the ſame at firſt: ſo our conſcience being of it ſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſily terrified with apprehenſion of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, at the leaſt croſs accident which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals it, repents of its action with incredible anguiſh &amp; regret. In which condition a man is very prone to take up a perſwaſion that the moſt ſafe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119039:104"/> is to have none at all, and ſo follow the maxime of thoſe who account it better to miſs of gain then to put themſelves in ſo great a hazard of loſs. Now if any one ſhould demand how then it came to paſs that all Pagan Nations have each of them had their particular Religion, &amp; that theſe conſiderations have not been available to divert them from embracing ſome or other; the reaſon is not difficultly given thereof. Amongſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans ſome were contemners of the Gods; and if they did addict themſelves to Religion, it was but by a maner of caution, leaſt they ſhould incur the univerſal hatred of the world; and ſo never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred at all into ſo profound a diſquiſition concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe matters. Others had not indeed a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion revealed from Heaven; but yet they thought ſo at leaſt: and this falſe opinion oblig'd them to the exerciſe of their devotions, almoſt as ſtrongly as if they had aſſuredly known them to be true and good. For whether the reaſons that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us any thing be good or bad, yet the ſame motions in a manner are excited by ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which the clear and ſolid knowledge of the truth would raiſe in us. There is no conſiderable difference, ſaving in the vehemence, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in the conſtancy of thoſe motions, no more then there is between the joy of one that ha's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN this contention againſt the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> I ought to have queſtion'd whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Humane Soul to be Immortal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they which anciently were of this ſect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it mortal as that of Brutes is; ſo that if they of the preſent Generation will follow the traces of their predeceſſors, they muſt alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them in this opinion. And neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I can ſcarce be perſwaded that our Times could bring forth men ſo unnatural againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; unleſs perhaps ſome wild diſſolute young perſons, whoſe minds are wholly taken up with Wine and Women. But being now to diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that acknowledge a Providence in God by which he governs the Univerſe, I muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe that they eſteem their Souls ſurvive their bodies, and that death hath no power over them. So we find that all ſuch as believed a Providence, have likewiſe taught the Immortality of our Souls, as things inſeparably conjoyn'd; excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Saduces,</hi> who having the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> to inſtruct them, ought to be judg'd the blindeſt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:119039:105"/> people of the World, that could not diſcern this truth therein. For all Religion being founded on this Hypotheſis that our Souls are incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſeeing they acknowledge God to have been the Author of the Religion taught and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe Books, why ſhould they not likewiſe acknowledge that God did by the ſame means e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh and confirm this Common Hypotheſis. Truely all Religion aims at a double End, The il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrating the glory of God's Providence and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and The comforting good men in their afflictions. Now whereas good men fall into ſo many calamities in the World, but Wicked often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proſper, and that even the Good are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the wicked, what glory would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to that Providence from a Religion, which ſhould conſtitute no time at all after this Life, in which the Good might receive comfort for their ſufferings, &amp; the Bad vengeance for their crimes. What great commendation were it to preſide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the mixture of Elements in the compoſition of Things, and to cauſe every one to follow its nature regularly, and in the mean time to take no care of thoſe which reverence the Deity, but connive at the lewdneſſes of ſuch as contemn him? Not to conduct the courſe of Nature in a due manner, might ſpeak ſome defect of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; But not to compenſate the Virtue of the Good, nor puniſh the crimes of the Vitious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the defect of Wiſdom in not adjuſting things aright ſutably to their qualifications, and croſſely coupling proſperity with Vice, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery with Virtue, there would be a too notorious defect of goodneſs and juſtice. And perhaps it
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:119039:105"/> would not be leſs expedient to follow the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Epicurus</hi> (which notwithſtanding we have convinced of infinite abſurdities and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) then to aſcribe a Providence to the Deity, and not to believe the immortality of the Soul: it being leſs unworthy the Divine Nature to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Univerſe altogether, then to adminiſter humane affairs with ſo much negligence, injuſtice and irregularity. But if there redounds little glory to the wiſe, good and juſt Providence of God from ſuch a Religion, there accrues no more conſolation to men; there being ſo ſmall grounds to expect the remuneration of Virtue in this Life, that the greateſt admirers of it, perceiving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fall ſhort of their attempt, at the end of their account, term her a meer vain ſhadow; and moſt deſerving perſons complain, that all things fall out prepoſterouſly to their hopes, while they obſerve unjuſt men flouriſhing in the midſt of Pompe and Pleaſure, and themſelves inſulted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and oppreſs'd by arrogant and haughty Wickedneſs. For as for what is alledged, that all the Bleſſings which God promiſes in the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> to thoſe whom he preſcribes a Religion to upon his Covenant, are of Temporal things, which have no further relation then onely to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this Life, and therefore there can be no certain proof of the Souls immortality drawn from thence; if it were ſo, the Covenant would be fruſtraneous and to no purpoſe. For I dare boldly affirm that of all thoſe which are therein recorded with praiſe for religiouſly obſerving it, not one did attain, I do not ſay a perfect felicity of the preſent life ſo long as it laſted, for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:119039:106"/> of his Piety, but not ſo much as might coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervale the afflictions which he ſuffered. In ſo much that God himſelf in atteſting their conſtant obſervance of his Covenant, ſhould accuſe and condemn himſelf of being deficient towards them; ſince they liv'd miſerably for the greateſt part of their Days. And thoſe words of <hi>Jacob, My days have been few and evil,</hi> would be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal reproach to his promiſes and his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Wherefore it muſt either be denyed that there was any Religion conſtituted by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees</hi> muſt confeſs that the immortality of the Soul is preſuppoſed therein and confirmed by the teſtimony of God himſelf; ſince the belief of the corruptibility of our minds ſubverts the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Religion in the World.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, although the Doctrines of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and the Souls immortality are inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly allied, and the latter is alſo demonſtrated by invincible reaſons which we deduc'd briefly a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle above, yet it ha's hapned to it, as to divers other fundamental verities in Religion, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that men remaind in ſuſpence concerning the ſame, till they were acertain'd of it by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation. So that the moſt knowing <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> (from whom Learning deſcended to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>) ſpake ſo doubtfully of it, that it is not plainly known what they conceived about it: and they which moſt inclined to believe their Minds immortal, never declar'd themſelves very poſitively that they thought ſo. Some have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated that <hi>Thales</hi> was the firſt among the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers that believ'd the Immortality of our Souls,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:119039:106"/> and indeed he is the firſt of whom <hi>Greece</hi> boaſted for Philoſophy. Before he and the reſt which were termed Wiſemen in his time ſet themſelves to refine and regulate it, all that had attempted any thing, left it but in a rude dreſs and unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly equipage. And it is a great evidence of the truth of this Doctrine, and a fair inſtance of the Providence of God in favour of it, that that Schole of Wiſdom among the Pagans began to be poliſh'd and perfected by it, and was as it were built upon this foundation. But into how many ſects did Philoſophy ſoon after degenerate, of which there were ſome that expreſly denied it, and others which made a doubt of it as of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things? With what ambiguity and incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have even they ſpoke of it, who ſeem'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to teach it? <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is extremely intricate about it, and ſeems ſometimes to affirm one thing and ſometimes another. Nor can it be conjectur'd why he ſo dubiouſly explicated himſelf in this point, being otherwiſe wonderfully eloquent and happy in his expreſſions, unleſs either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew not well what to hold, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares freely in one place, <hi>That it is not yet evident what the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of men may be;</hi> or becauſe he believed that the Soul is extinguiſht with the Body, and yet would not pronounce it openly, for fear of giving ſcandal; as there are found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brave ſpirits, who living amongſt men of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition are content to diſſemble their opinions in matters of this nature. So likewiſe he ſeems to have diſſembled what he thought of the beſt Form of Government, for fear of offending <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> I am willing to aſcribe my ſelf into the number of them
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:119039:107"/> who believe that there is greater apparance that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was of the Opinion that affirms the Souls immortality, and I know many excellent paſſages may be produc'd out of his Writings which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor it. But yet ſo it is, that in other places he ſeems to lay down principles which are incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with the ſame, and ſome of his moſt famous diſciples have believ'd that he held the contrary. <hi>Socrates,</hi> as we find in <hi>Plato,</hi> knows not how to be confident of it, and perſwades himſelf by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which for the moſt part are but of ſlender moment; and always ſpeaks of it, as of other things, with doubting, and not determining any thing: although through the deſire he had that his Soul were immortal, he inclined more willingly to this opinion, and accounted it of moſt probability: which is <hi>Cicero</hi>'s judgement in his <hi>Tuſculan</hi> Queſtions. And, truly, I conceive that in all things of this Nature the vulgar had better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions then the Philoſophers; yea, that the Philoſophers corrupted the ſentiments of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which remain'd more lively and genuine in the breaſts of the people. For they had wit and knowledge enough, to frame objections againſt the common conceptions of men, but yet they had not ſufficient to reſolve them; whence their minds became unſetled and wavering. Whereas the people, who underſtood not ſo much ſubtilty, held themſelves more firmely to that which was taught them by nature it ſelf, and they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from her, though doubtingly, in regard of the weakneſs and ignorance of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. As it often falls out, that a man that knows nothing in Civil Law, and yet hath ſome natural
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:119039:107"/> faculty of underſtanding, better diſcerns the right of a certain Caſe, then knowing Profeſſors who have their heads full of Statutes and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs; great skill rather perplexing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding then reſolving them in the knowledge of things. But Philoſophical diſputes being ſpread from the Scholes into Towns among the people have obſcured and diſorder'd ſuch natural notions, much more then the people by their own ignorance and negligence could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and embroiled the ſame of themſelves. However, were they much better aſſured then they are that their Souls do not periſh with their bodies, yet they muſt neceſſarily be extremely ignorant of the eſtate of them after their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For how blind ſo ever the reaſon of man be in that which concerns the Deity, his Nature, Perfections and Providence, yet the arguments which ſatisfie us of them are ſo clear and reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the World that in ſpight of all the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the humane Intellect, there is always ſome beam that breaks through, affording that dubious and confuſed knowledge we mentioned was found amongſt the Nations of the World. And how intangled ſoever the diſputes of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers were, the rational ſoul of Man gives al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo many proofs of its incorruptibility, that the knowledge thereof cannot be totally extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd. But as to its eſtate after this Life, it is not onely impoſſible for men to divine of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what it will be, by reaſon of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and irregularity which is befallen their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, but though the eye of their reaſon were as clear and luminous as could be deſir'd, yet
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:119039:108"/> they were hardly able to make the leaſt probable conjecture concerning it, becauſe God hath written nothing of it in the book of Nature, from which we draw all our knowledge. But they which are inſtructed by Religion in the Hiſtory of the Worlds Original, can very eaſily give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof. For God having produc'd Man in the Nature of things, in ſuch an eſtate that if he had perſiſted in it, he ſhould not have feared death, the revelation of that eſtate which muſt follow this Life would have been unprofitable to him, who was made, in caſe that the deſign of his creation had been purſued, to live perpetually in the World, and never to undergo the ſeparation of his Soul from his Body. For that Truth teaches us (and likewiſe reaſon being informed in this particular either conſents to, or is convinced of it) that it was the Offence which the Firſt Man committed, which introduced death into the World. To what purpoſe therefore ſhould God have imprinted in Nature any evidence or token of the eſtate of man after death, ſince in that firſt integrity of nature, there was no ſuſpition nor ſhadow of Death it ſelf? It is true, indeed, that God denounced to man, that if he degenerated from his integrity, he ſhould dye; which might have occaſion'd ſome thought in him of the pains which follow death, being he knew that his Soul was immortal. But the apprehenſion of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after ſin, and alſo of that which follows death, do's not infer any other of remuneration, unleſs God reveal mercy and hope of pardon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the tranſgreſſion. Which God had not as yet done in the integrity of Nature. So that man
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:119039:108"/> having from God neither hope of pardon in caſe he ſhould ſin, nor any cauſe to think of death in caſe he ſhould not ſin, he had no occaſion to raiſe his mind higher towards a better life. But if any one conceives ſome ſcruple touching the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of the life of man upon the Earth, if he had not fallen into ſin, and imagines rather that God, after he had leſt him for ſome Ages in the World to practice obedience and virtue, would have at laſt taken him to himſelf, and given a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe then that which he could have injoy'd in a terreſtrial felicity, he muſt alſo confeſs that to inſtate man in the injoyment of ſuch remunerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there would have been no need of Death, and ſo that it was not neceſſarily for him to know what the eſtate of his Soul after ſeparation from his body ſhould be. Moreover, whatſoever that compenſation would have been which man ſhould have received for his Obedience and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, inſomuch as it would have been a condition and a glory ſupernatural, ſome revelation of it muſt neceſſarily have been made by another way, then nature; namely, then by the evidences which may be had from conſideration of the Works of God, and the Government of the World. And in truth, to hear the Poets and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſpeak of it, ſufficiently evinces that ſuch as have had no other light to guid them in ſearch of theſe things, but that of Nature and Reaſon, have onely groped in the dark. For how ridiculous is the deſcription which they make of the Infernal Regions and <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields? Is it not pleaſant to behold the Landſkip which <hi>Virgil</hi> hath drawn of them in the ſixth Book of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:119039:109"/> his <hi>Aeneids?</hi> where he ſpeaks of <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> and the ſeverity of his ſentences; and forgets not to paint out <hi>Tyſiphone</hi> with her ſcourges and ſerpents, together with the Furies. He alſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there hideous <hi>Hydra</hi>'s, and I know not what kind of other vile beaſts at the gates of Hell; and in that horrible priſon which he repreſents twice as deep as heaven is high above us, he lodges the <hi>Titans,</hi> the <hi>Aliodes,</hi> and <hi>Salmoneus.</hi> There is alſo <hi>Tityus,</hi> who covers nine Acres of Ground with his body, and whoſe growing entrals are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually devoured by a Vulture. And not far from him the <hi>Lapith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </hi> with <hi>Ixion</hi> and <hi>Pirithous,</hi> over whoſe heads hang great rocks ready to fall upon them. He aſſigns there to ſome for their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to roul a great ſtone eternally; and faſtens others to the Spokes of a Wheel that turns about inceſſantly, and tortures as it turns. He fixes the poor <hi>Theſeus</hi> upon his ſeat, and condemns him never to ſtir from it, being a torment fitted to a man that loved to travel; and at laſt concludes that if he had a hundred tongues and as many mouths, he could not recount all the ſorts of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments wherewith ſinners are tortured in that place. As for good men, he allots them more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of air, and a more ſpatious habitation, where the ſkie is diſplay'd with a fair purple light, and they behold their Sun and their Stars as we do ours: there ſome exerciſe themſelves in various ſorts of combats, as leaping, running on the graſs, and wraſtling on the Sand: others dance to the Muſick of <hi>Orpheus</hi>'s Violin; and ſo others divert themſelves with other ſports and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations. Are not theſe whimſies very capable of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:119039:109"/> giving ſatisfaction to thoſe which read them? Nor can it be ſaid theſe extravagances are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar onely to the Poets, but that other men and eſpecially Philoſophers held more rational opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For, as I formerly ſaid, the Poets were the Divines of the Pagans, chiefly in theſe matters, ſo that the Philoſophers themſelves admitted their fancies into their doctrines. Indeed <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in the Treatiſe which he writ upon this Motto <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſeems to offer at ſome more reaſonable interpretation of thoſe follies, then what they preſent to the underſtanding at the firſt view: but nevertheleſs all the explication which he gives of them, amounts onely to this that the wicked Souls are plunged and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd in the perpetual oblivion of all things. And in his <hi>Conſolation</hi> directed to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> he adheres to the opinion of <hi>Pindar</hi> concerning the place and ſtate of the Happy, which <hi>Pindar</hi> in the place which he alledges, deſcribes almoſt after the ſame manner that <hi>Virgil</hi> doth, who ſeems to have imitated him. If an Author ſo grave and judicious as <hi>Plutarch</hi> was, ſuffer'd himſelf to be deluded with theſe fine imaginations, what ſhall we think of all other people, who were of mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er capacities then he, not of the vulgar pitch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but even among Philoſophers? But truely, their blindneſs in this matter muſt be favourably cenſur'd; ſince in other things they could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and argue againſt Fables, and obſerve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that the combates of the Gods one againſt another, their Loves, Hatreds and Jealouſies, their imployments of the Forge and Spinſtry, their <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> were but pleaſant ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:119039:110"/> or Romantick fancies of <hi>Homer</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of Poets. The light of Reaſon ennabled them wherewith to encounter theſe ſtories, ſo that they were not onely convinced of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but invented ſomewhat of greater ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but in this particular, if they beheld abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which they were not able to maintain, they were not able to ſubſtitute any truths in their place. So that it was neceſſary for them either to admit ſuch Trifles, as ſome did, or to live in a moſt profound ignorance of the eſtate of their Souls after the diſſolution of the body, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed moſt ordinary. And <hi>Epicurus</hi> knew no better way to interpret the Allegory of thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ables, then to bring Hell up into the Earth, and to affirm that all which the Poets relate of the things below, as of the rock which hangs over the head of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> and the Rowling-ſtone of <hi>Siſyphus,</hi> and <hi>Tityus</hi>'s Liver which is continually devoured by birds of prey, and the Tun of the <hi>Danaides,</hi> which could not be fil'd wtth all their pains in lading water into it, is felt onely in this life by covetous, ambitious and fearful minds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agitated with their own exorbitant paſſions. In a word, the ſoul of man being extinguiſht when the body dyes, all that is reported of Hell and things done there is frivolous; and <hi>Cerberus</hi> and the <hi>Furies,</hi>

                  </q> Now it cannot be expreſt of how great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance this ignorance is to the life of men. For as the hope of recompenſe is a quick ſpur to Virtue, ſo is the fear of puniſhment a moſt efficacious bridle to reſtrain from Vice; ſo that the ſtudy of that and the hatred of this increaſes or diminiſhes according to the proportion of knowledge which we have of the reward prepared for us. And the more men are corrupt, as experience ſhows they are infinitely, the leſs do they prize Virtue for it ſelf, and on the contrary their inclinations are more violently carried forth to vice. Which is an argument, that 'tis only the fear of puniſhment and the hope of compenſation which moves them, not the native beauty of Virtue or defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Vice. Whence in ſo groſs an ignorance of their condition after this life, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they ſhould be effectually reclaimed from the one or duely excited to the other. So that the concluſion clearly reſults that God muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal himſelf from Heaven to be the rewarder of Virtue, and the ſevere avenger of Vice, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Life, but alſo in that which is to come, by giving a ſufficient information of the quality of the reward. And becauſe ſo long as we are cloathed with this body and accuſtomed
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:119039:111"/> to ſenſible and corporeal things, we can ſcarce comprehend any thing but by the Miniſtery of the Senſes or under the image of ſenſible things; if ſuch revelation be expreſs'd in Allegoricall ſpeeches, taken from what is moſt ardently deſired or feared in the world, it is requiſite Firſt that ſuch deſcription be grave, and ſavouring nothing of the weakneſs of the mind of man, which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in thoſe of the Poets. In the next place, there muſt be in ſuch a revelation in which the penalties and recompenſes to come are veiled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of corporeal and ſenſible things, other ſimple deſcriptions, to explain ſuch as are typified, and give us to underſtand that both what it promiſes, and what it threatens ſhall be in a manner proportionable to the nature of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls, and not extravagant or incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therewith.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, it is neceſſary that ſuch revelation be accompani'd with ſo clear evidence of its ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial and divine original, that the aſſurance which it gives that thoſe promiſes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings come from God himſelf, as if he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them with his own mouth, may beget an immutable certainty that although the expreſſions be Allegorical, yet the reality equals or ſurpaſſes them; which unqueſtionably produces wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects. Whereas the opinion, that other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions found in the Books of Poets are hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions, diſparages their authority, and ſo renders them wholly ineffectual. Let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now to the other point of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:119039:111"/>
               <p>Becauſe, as it hath been ſhewn, all knowledge which we have of God comes either from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular revelation, or from contemplation of his Works; and that all our piety is deriv'd from, and regulated according to the meaſure of ſuch knowledge: it is of high importance eſpecially to thoſe who acknowledge no particular revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the end they may become truely pious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, to have an exact knowledge of his Works; namely of the World, and the things contained therein. I demand therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they believe that God is the author of the World. For if they do not, but deny that he created the matter out of nothing of which it is compos'd, or introduc'd the form into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which we behold in it, they are as much at a loſs, as <hi>Epicurus,</hi> to make out whence they learn't that God is powerful, or what is the meaſure of his power; ſo far are they from being able to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelves that it is infinite. There is indeed a great Virtue requiſite for the adminiſtring of Providence, and which being duely conſidered by right reaſon, is found to be infinite. But if there hath ever been one perſon among the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers that reaſon'd in this manner, God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the world, Therefore his power is unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (which I do not meet with any that ha's done) there are found a thouſand who conceived that God employ'd his utmoſt ſkill and ability in the government of the World, and that his object was proportionable to his power; ſo that being but ſufficient to all the World, he was not able to remove ſo much as one ſtraw beſides, unleſs he ſhould during that little ſpace ſurceaſe his action
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119039:112"/> by which he moves all this great maſs of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. Whereas they which believe that God created the World, and that he created it of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, do neceſſarily imply in that belief this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that his power is immenſe, ſince there is an infinite diſtance between Being and Not-being, and thoſe two terms (as they ſpeak) cannot be conjoyn'd, nor the one be paſs'd from to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by a power of infinite extent. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe people cannot adore God with aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in reference to the infiniteneſs of his power. For that right reaſon which is neceſſary to frame reaſonings from the conduct of Providence which may infer the immenſity of the power of God is not to be found in any of mankind ſince the corruption which befell it. Moreover they deprive themſelves of the faireſt inducement to praiſe and thankſgiving which can be imagin'd. For if God did not create the World, he ha's not manifeſted any proof of his goodneſs in giving Being to the Creatures, which is infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Not-being, and conſequently deſerves an infinite gratitude, if man were capable of performing it. If particularly he did not create the World for man, nor gave him that dominion which he challenges over all things by imagining himſelf the King of the Univerſe, he does not ow him one word of thanks, and ha's no reaſon to ſay as a great King once did;

                     <l>With Majeſty and Glory crown'd;</l>
                     <l>The King of all thy Creatures made;</l>
                     <l>That all beneath his Feet haſt laid;</l>
                     <l>All that on Dales or Mountaines feed,</l>
                     <l>That ſhady Woods or Deſarts breed;</l>
                     <l>What in the Airy Region glide,</l>
                     <l>Or through the rowling Ocean ſlide.</l>
                     <l>Lord, how illuſtrious is thy Name!</l>
                     <l>Whoſe power both Heaven and Earth proclame!</l>
                  </q> Which is reaſonably a hymne more agreeable and well-pleaſing to the Deity then the ſume of all the Incenſe of <hi>Arabia.</hi> But in the next place, what duty will man think he owes to God even for his Being, if he believes not that he receiv'd it from him? And will he not rather be ready to place himſelf equal with him, being not dependant of him for his Being, ſince there is nothing more renders things equal one to another then Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.</p>
               <p>It is true, it may perhaps be ſaid, that men are oblig'd to the Deity in as much as they depend of his Providence, becauſe if that did not preſide over natural cauſes and cauſe them to produce things neceſſary to the ſupport of Life, we could not ſubſiſt, and therefore he which gives the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a being obliges as much or more then he which gives the being it ſelf, and he that feeds and defends then he that begets.</p>
               <p>But this is a groſs miſtake of theirs, and their pretended reaſon deludes them. For if God be
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119039:113"/> not the Author of the World, how is he the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of it? Do's it not belong to him that made the Work to take the care of it? Whence hath he authority to intermeddle in the Works of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; or the World the neceſſity of being guided and preſerved by the hand of God, if it was not framed by the ſame? And indeed God muſt either be the author of the World; or Chance, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> affirmed; or as others, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or it had never any beginning, but hath exiſted from all eternity. If it was Chance that made the world, then conſequently it is alſo preſerved and governed by the ſame hazard. And truely <hi>Epicurus</hi> was conſiſtent with his own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples when he denied Providence. For if the World was thus framed by the fortuitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Atomes, there is no need for Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to put its hand to ſupport it; ſince it might be preſerv'd in its Being by the ſame means by which it was produc'd; the conſervation of things being not more difficult then their firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. If it was made by Nature, I demand, what that is? For if by Nature they mean the order which is in the things of the World, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which cauſes produce effects ſutable to themſelves, certainly and determinately, namely, both univerſal cauſes, as the Heavens, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as Animals and Plants; they are not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken. We deſire to know who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that order; ſeeing order cannot be the author of it ſelf. For beſides that nothing is able to produce it ſelf into Being, order is an effect of a Cauſe indowed with Underſtanding, but hath no underſtanding it ſelf; in as much as Order is a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119039:113"/> diſpoſition and relation according to which things are both conveniently marſhall'd among themſelves and rationally ſubordinated to ſome certain end. Now who will ſay that this relation and diſpoſition of things among themſelves is it ſelf indued with underſtanding. And if the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things did not produce, neither is it able to preſerve it ſelf. It belongs to the ſame faculty to preſerve and make it. If by the Word Nature, they underſtand the world it ſelf, compoſed and contrived with all the things in the order we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, or as the Author of the Book <hi>De Mundo</hi> ſpeaks, the well ordered <hi>compages</hi> of all the parts of the Univerſe, How could that make it ſelf? For the thing which makes, exiſts already, and that which is making is not yet exiſtent. The Carver is before the Statue, and the Watch-maker be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Springs that point out the hour, yea even before he begins to make them. But the Statue or the Watch, though begun, are neither of them ſuch; nor yet when they are in making; till the whole work be compleated, and all the parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted and united in due order. In like manner, if the world made it ſelf, it was before its own being, namely the world producing before the world produced, though but one and the ſame World. Which is a like folly as if a man ſhould ſay that he begat himſelf, without a father. Whence alſo it follows, that it is not able to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern or ſupport and maintain it ſelf; no more then a Watch is if there be no body to fit and guide its Wheels and Springs, and to winde it up, and duely order it. If they ſay that the World is eternal, is it ſo without dependance on
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119039:114"/> God, or is it eternal by emanation from him; as the Light of the Sun is of as great duration as the Sun it ſelf? If it be eternal with dependance on the Deity, then God having produc'd the World as naturally as the fire burns or the Sun ſhines, muſt alſo preſerve it in the ſame manner: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will be a natural action, there will be no obligation to him for it, in as much as he can do no otherwiſe, as the Sun cannot reſtrain its beams nor withhold its light from illuminating the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>And moreover ſuch conſervation of the World will be no longer an act of Providence. For that can never be termed Providence, which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable neceſſity of things depending on their indiſſoluble natural connexion. So that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with what reaſon the <hi>Stoicks</hi> called their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal deſtiny Providence, or thought thoſe two things compatible together. For whereas Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence adminiſters things with a freedom of Wil, what Liberty can there be in the conduct of that which depends on a fatal and Determinate neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; which is precedent to any act of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? If it be eternal without dependance on the Deity, it is it ſelf God, as ſome heretofore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it. And becauſe that which is eternal is alſo immutable, and maintains it ſelf always uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly, neither ſhall God have any right to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the government of the World, which does not depend on him, nor the World any neceſſity of being governed or preſerved by him; ſince there would be no change to be feared in it, its own eternity exempting it from all ſubjection to alteration. Wherefore it muſt either be confeſs'd
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119039:114"/> that the World had God for its Author, or denied that God is any thing at all concern'd in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and preſervation of the World.</p>
               <p>Now there is one thing conſiderable above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Which is, that though theſe reaſons be ſo evident that nothing can be brought againſt them to refell them, yet there was never any man that perceiv'd them clearly, unleſs he were firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed of the creation of the World in the Books of <hi>Moſes. Ariſtotle</hi> believed it eternal; <hi>Plato</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed eternity onely to the Matter; and in his Dialogue of the Creation he commits ſo many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences unworthy ſo great a Philoſopher, that he that ha's the patience to read, will partly laugh at his conceipts and partly pity his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances; and eſteem it as eaſie to combine the Atomes of <hi>Democritus</hi> together, as to conjoyn the minute ſubtleties of thoſe Platonical ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Beſides, I am not ſatisfi'd (and the opinion of thoſe which affirm it hath very great probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of truth) but <hi>Plato</hi> might have learn't all he knew of this matter from tradition of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> and <hi>Syrians,</hi> who had receiv'd it from <hi>Moſes;</hi> for he had travell'd into thoſe Countries, and was there imbued with truths formerly unknown in <hi>Greece;</hi> but afterwards endevour'd to cloath the ſame in the dreſs of Philoſophy, to the end they might be more readily entertain'd by his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And being paſſionately devoted to Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, &amp; obſerving, what is moſt true, that all things were fram'd with a wonderful wiſdom, as it were by weight, rule and meaſure, he interweav'd his Diſcourſe with ſplendid conceptions of Lines, Proportions &amp; Numbers. Whence it came to paſs,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:119039:115"/> that <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who did not attribute much to the tradition of others, but examined all things by his own reaſon, and otherwiſe obſerved an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable confuſion in all theſe Numbers of <hi>Plato,</hi> and moreover, perhaps took too much pleaſure in oppoſing his Opinions, deſigning to get all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to himſelf, which he detracted from his Maſter (as <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf complains in <hi>Diog. Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> that he had us'd him as rudely as young Colts that kick their Dams) and ſo diſceded from his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and introduc'd that of the eternity of the World, with dependance on the Deity, although ſuch a dependance as infers a neceſſary and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral production. And upon this conſideration, as God willing we ſhall ſhew more amply hereafter, he ſeems to have had ſo cold a reſpect for the Deity.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any ground to imagine that the Philoſophers of latter times are more intelligent in theſe matters then thoſe of old were; ſince the World furniſhes them with no new arguments, nor Nature with new faculties or otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to comprehend the ſame. They know, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the World was created, and have a clearer underſtanding of the truth of arguments which confirm it, then the ancients, and even then right reaſon it ſelf could ſupply them with: but it is ſince the thing was acertained by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if they would be ingenuous to confeſs it, they learn't it from the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But, what (will ſome ſay) could not <hi>Moſes</hi> perhaps have a greater reach of wit then <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and ſo invent arguments of himſelf, and ſound the truth to the bottom, and then communicate
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:119039:115"/> it to others; and that without any eſpecial reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, although he boaſted thereof, to gain grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authority amongſt his people? Truely a very vain objection, and a pitiful ſubterfuge. For what ſhould have hindred him from declaring his reaſons, as well as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath done his? And nevertheleſs he makes a very plain Narration of it, as <hi>Galen</hi> reproaches to him. And if his deſign were to enhance his authority, and ſo render thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whom he commanded more plyable and flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble out of reſpect to the Deity, why did he refuſe that charge of exerciſing authority over that people and to conduct them? And how does he boaſt of ſo many miracles, which might have been contradicted by men then living, if the relation of them had not been true? Why did he refer all to the glory of God and nothing to his own? Or if his project were to credit himſelf onely by miſpriſing and debaſing his own worth, why did he not at leaſt leave that authority to his children, rather then to his domeſtick ſervant? But he was ſo far from that, that contrarily to what naturall affections dictate to men, he made one of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants heir of his grandeur, and left his own iſſue to fall into a low and contemptible condition in compariſon of his own. Certainly, it muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſaid that <hi>Moſes</hi> was an impoſtor in forging both the hiſtory of the creation and others which he relates; or, if any credit be given to him in the narration of that Hiſtory ſo remote from his own times, then much rather ought he to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his recital of things which befell himſelf, of which there were ſo many witneſſes either to confirm, or convince them of falſity. And ſurely
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:119039:116"/> they are abundantly confirmed in that they were never ſo much as accuſed or ſuſpected. Beſides that their Poſterity ha's received them from hand to hand as divine irrefragable truths, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly maintained them for the ſpace of many Ages. Which they would never have done, if the tradition of thoſe ancient miracles had not from time to time been rendred authentique and worthy of perfect belief, by extraordinary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, predictions, judgements and deliverances in which appeared the ſinger of God. I ſhall ſay ſomething more, ſince the matter leads me to it: Namely; that if the Philoſophers, againſt whom I diſpute at preſent, have vivacity and quicknes enough of underſtanding, to be certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſwaded of the Creation of the World by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which their Wit is able to ſuggeſt to them, and the Ancients did not obſerve, I dare aver that would they take pains in reading the Books ot <hi>Moſes</hi> with as much attention as they uſe in their own ratiocinations, they would there more certainly remark that they are proceeded from divine inſpiration, then they could know of themſelves that God ha's created and governs the World. For there are not more lively and evident arguments in the World, that God is the Author of it, then there are in the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> alone, to induce a belief that they are not of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane invention. As I conceive, if a man ſhould have from the hand of <hi>Archimedes</hi> himſelf the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of thoſe admirable Engines which he made, and that he had repleniſh'd the ſame with as many tokens of his incomparable ſkill in the Mathematicks, as there are traces of the Deity in the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:119039:116"/> five books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he would find therein as much or more cauſe to admire the extraordinary grandeur of that Perſonages Wit, as in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively conſidering his Machines and his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> How much true Godlineſs is concern'd in the certain knowledge, That the whole World is governed by a ſpecial Providence; and That the ſame is no otherwiſe attainable but by Revelation.</head>
               <p>HItherto we have diſcours'd largely of the Providence which governs the World, and treated with the Philoſophers of our Times as with perſons that acknowledge it; and yet we are not fully aſſured what their judgement is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concerning it, although it be a thing highly important to our diſpute. For the Opinions of the Ancients have been very different about it, and the Moderns hide themſelves, and do not willingly appear in publick, in regard that the Chriſtian Religion being univerſally receiv'd in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſuch as do not believe the ſame, are look'd upon as Monſters; ſo that it is very difficult to know diſtinctly what opinion they have of it. If therefore they be of that perſwaſion which is attributed to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (though ſome undertake to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:119039:117"/> excuſe him from it) their piety towards the Deity muſt conſequently be wholly cold and languid. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is accounted to have believ'd that the world being from eternity by emanation from God, as the light proceeds from the Sun, things are ſo neceſſarily diſpoſed, that God being the firſt Mover of the Heavens, whether immediately or by the intervention of what he calls Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, he is alſo by conſequence the Author of all things. Becauſe the other leſs univerſal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions depend on the Heavens, and from thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſs univerſal motions proceed all things which are produced in the World; every cauſe acting ſutable to its own Nature; as the Water moves the wheel of a Mill, and the wheel the Axeltree, and that another leſs wheel, and this alſo another, till at length the motion arrives at the ſtone which bruiſes the corn and reduces the ſame into flower. So that God is indeed authour of all things, but as a univerſal cauſe, which hath under it an infinite number of other ſubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate and ſubordinate, which are the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſes of effects which come into Being, and which receive their power of acting from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the firſt and moſt univerſal of all by the means of motion. And foraſmuch as things which are termed fortuitous and contingent, do not depend on certain determined cauſes which are ligned by a ſort of train to that ſuperior &amp; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal one, and conſequently if they be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by God they are adminiſtred by an Eſpecial Providence; they which diſcourſe at that rate take no notice at all of them, no more then of a thing which does not agree with their Principles. Nor
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:119039:117"/> can it be denyed but that grand Philoſopher ſeems very frequently to lay down the grounds of this Divinity, although ſometimes excellent ſentences eſcape from him to the honor of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Providence, which is extended even to caſual things or ſuch as depend not on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation of natural cauſes. But it is to be fear'd that they are words ſpoken out of deſign to avoid the reproach which would have lain upon him of being too little religious, or at moſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and flaſhes of Nature, which oftentimes ſurmounts the moſt deeply imprinted perverſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and cauſes a man to forget his own Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes when they are contrary unto it, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and reſolved ſoever he be to maintain the ſame. The Author of the Book <hi>De Mundo,</hi> dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſeems to go a little higher, and ſpeaks of God and his Providence in more magnificent terms. But in the firſt place the ſtile evidently ſhews, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> never writ it, and I ſhould readily incline to their opinion who father it on <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> whom the Books of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had imbued with many better and ſounder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in relation to piety, then all that ever was met with in <hi>Greece:</hi> but he diſguiſed himſelf on purpoſe, and accommodated that elegant Treatiſe after the <hi>Greek</hi> mode. Secondly, in caſe it had proceeded from the hand of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> yet it always terminates in this, that God keeps himſelf in the Heavens onely, and that it is not ſutable to his glorious nature to be amongſt frail and viſible things, and that he governs the World by means of ſubordinate cauſes in nature, as the great King of <hi>Perſia</hi> do's his Providences
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:119039:118"/> by his Lieutenants and <hi>Satrapae.</hi> Laſtly, ſo little do's he think that a ſpecial Providence takes care of all particular events of things which are called contingent, that he excludes God as much as he can from their adminiſtration, and from all little inconſiderable accidents, as eſteeming them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his excellence: ſo far is he from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting God to preſide abſolutely over the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings and Wills of men, and that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all their moſt inward and abſtruſe thoughts. All the Rhetorick which he imploys to deduce this moſt elegantly, and adorn it with the choiſeſt flowers of Oratory and Poetry, amounts onely to this, without carrying it further. Now this doctrine can by no means be judged capable of begetting true piety in the hearts of men. For ſince they deſcribe that action of God in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, as a natural thing, and by conſequence neceſſarily determin'd, ſo that nothing can be attributed to the Goodneſs or free will of God, what obligation can men think they have to him, any more then they have to the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> which hurrieth all the Celeſtial Spheres along with it with a natural violence, which they are not able to reſiſt. For though he be the ſupreme cauſe of all, and involves all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yet if a man be once perſwaded that God is bound to that action by a natural neceſſity, he will not conceive himſelf more beholden to him for it, then to the Fire becauſe it burns, or to the Air in regard it fills all the extent of Nature. Yea, it is queſtionable whether in ſtead of being incited to venerate him, men would not rather e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem his condition miſerable, to be perpetually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:119039:118"/> to the Heavens to move them, without being able to ſlacken one moment, any more then <hi>Ixion</hi> to ſtay his wheel. But putting the caſe that men notwithſtanding account that action to proceed from the free will of God (which yet is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their principles) and let us ſee on what inducements they will render praiſe and thankſgiving to God. Namely, for that he moves the Heavens, and the Heavens tranſmit their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences to the Earth, and impart their virtues to the Elements, that ſo herbs may grow and fruits ripen, for the ſupply of nouriſhment to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and laſtly for that by the ſame ways he gives animals the power to bring forth young ones, for the propagation and perpetuity of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Species. Now in an unexpected danger of which there are ſo many and various ſorts which threaten men continually, and oftentimes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, how will they turn their eyes and minds towards the Heavens to implore the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, ſeeing he ha's no care but of what he does naturally, and abandons contingent things to fortune? And when a man ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from the danger of the fall of a houſe, or the aſſault of an Aſſaſſin, or the enterpriſe of a Poiſoner, with what zeal will he thank the Deity, who ha's no regard thereof? Now our whole Life is full of ſuch misfortunes; and that which befalls us according to the ordinary ways of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is that which is moſt rare in all her courſe. Moreover experience is to every man the miſtreſs of this truth, that things, which are common to us with all other men, how excellent ſoever they be, yet they do not much affect us: onely
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:119039:119"/> particular accidents make a lively impreſſion in our minds. So that a man will look upon himſelf as more oblig'd to a Phyſitian, that ſecur'd him from loſs of one of his Eys, which a defluction threatned him with, then to God that gave him both, with the injoyment of the light of the Sun at his birth. But above all the reſt, the ignorance of that Singular Providence which preſides in the minds of men themſelves, and over their thoughts, will cauſe a ſignal prejudice to true piety therein. For Wiſdom and Virtue being the moſt excellent of all Preſents that can come from the hand of God to humane creatures, if we do not conceive that we hold them from him, we ſhall never return him the praiſe of them; we ſhall pride up our ſelves and become preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, even ſo far as to rank our ſelves equal with him, yea above him, accordingly as we find in <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> ſuch brave ſentences as theſe; That a Wiſeman owes his Being indeed to the Deity; but as for his Well-being, which conſiſts in Wiſdom, he ows the ſame abſolutely to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And moreover, that in this the Sage does in ſome manner go beyond <hi>Jupiter;</hi> in as much as <hi>Jupiter</hi> is good by the neceſſity of his Nature, and cannot be otherwiſe; but the other acquired his own Virtue by combating with diſcourſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt his corporeal appetites. A Soul tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this Philoſophy, and puſt up with ſo rank an arrogance, how can it ever perform any thing conſiderable in relation to piety? And yet thither it is that ignorance of this Providenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> carries us. But if they have a better opinion of Divine Providence, and ſubject not onely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:119039:119"/> but alſo contingent things, and our very thoughts to his conduct, we ſhall always return to demand of them, how they know it ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the World and the adminiſtration of it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with arguments enough, if we were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to comprehend them; But how do they know it? Indeed the Philoſophers and Poets ſometimes utter in their writings excellent elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giums of God: as among others, <hi>Plutark</hi> in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Diſcourſe <hi>De Sera Numinis Vindicta;</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> in an ancient Dialogue, attributed to <hi>Plato</hi> (whether it be his or not) ſays that Virtue is a thing that is not learnt as Arts and Sciences, but is given by Inſpiration, as ſome divine and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial beneficence. And <hi>Homer,</hi> as we have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated elſewhere, aſcribes to the Deity the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the extraordinary Motions of the Heart, eſpecially ſuch as are Heroical, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe do's <hi>Virgil</hi> following his example.</p>

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:119039:120"/> onely wiſh which men ought to make, is that the Deity would give them
<q>Mentem ſanam in corpore ſano,</q> ſeems to acknowledge that we hold both the one and the other from his liberality; which is a very authentique advowing of Providence. And it were eaſie to produce plenty of the like inſtances. But how little firm were all thoſe people in this belief? And of what inconſiderable efficacy were thoſe excellent ſentences amongſt the vulgar, yea amongſt Philoſophers and the Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? <hi>Plutark</hi> one of the moſt religious of all, relates very exactly how <hi>Timoleon</hi> was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly delivered from the conſpiracy of two mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, by the meeting of a certain perſon who to revenge the death of his father kill'd one of them as they were upon the point to give him the fatal blow, though he knew nothing of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But in ſtead of acknowledging the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God therein, he contents himſelf with ſaying that the ſpectators wondred greatly at the artifice and contrivance which fortune uſes, how ſhe carries on one deſign by help of another, and unites things ſo remote by liguing and chaining the ſame together, how different ſoever they be, for producing the effect ſhe reſolves on. And without inſerting any judgement of his own concerning God or his Providence, he onely ſays, that the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> underſtanding the deed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived good hopes thereby of ſucceſs in the war of <hi>Sicily,</hi> becauſe the General that manag'd it, was a ſacred perſon and favour'd of the Gods.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:119039:120"/> Leaving his Reader to divine what his own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent was of the matter. So in like manner when he ſpeaks of the different apprehenſions which the Fall of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> caus'd in the minds of them that liv'd in thoſe dayes, he declares that ſome were glad of his misfortunes, as if they would have trampled him under their feet whom Fortune had caſt down; others beheld him with ſome compaſſion, conſidering the great power ſecret and divine cauſes have over the weakneſs of Men, which appeared ſo remarkably in this Maſterpiece of Fortune. What other words do's he uſe to repreſent the wiſe Providence of God, then that by which blind and temerarious chance is ſignified? And laſtly that no man may think that by the term of Fortune he underſtood the provident Wiſdom of God, I ſhal here rehearſe his own words in his firſt book of the Opinions of Philoſophers, which I believe will cauſe aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in them who have any knowledge of that perſon. After having ſaid that <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> held that before God put his hand to the fabrick of the World, the bodies which we behold in motion were at reſt, but the Mind of God contriv'd and order'd the ſame; and that <hi>Plato</hi> on the other ſide, maintained that the particles of matter had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd motion, till God ranked and marſhall'd them, knowing that order is much better then confuſion, he adds, That, <hi>Herein they are both guilty of the ſame miſtake in eſteeming that God concerns himſelf with humane affairs, and that he made the World on purpoſe to govern it. For a nature ſo happy and incorruptible, and repleniſh'd with all ſorts of goods without any partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of evil, wholly addicted to preſerve its own
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:119039:121"/> beatitude and immortality, cannot be engaged in the care of things belonging to men; otherwiſe it would be unhappy, by being employ'd like a Labourer to carry great burdens, and to take pains in fabricating and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the world.</hi> You would think he had forſaken the Academy, and paſs'd into the School of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus.</hi> How could a man that is ſuſceptible of theſe rare opinions, have any thing certain in the knowledge of Providence, however ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſages ſometimes fall from him in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation? Moreover, let us call to minde what <hi>Cato</hi> himſelf ſaid and we touched above. This perſon, whom Nature had endued with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gravity, as <hi>Cicero</hi> reports, which was aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and confirmed by the doctrine of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks,</hi> the moſt ſevere of all others, and who extoll'd Providence to the higheſt, when he perceiv'd the affairs of the Commonwealth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline under the conduct of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who aſpir'd to Tyranny, to thrive and gather ſtrength, he complains that he beheld as he ſaid, a fallacious inſtability in the government of the Gods, in that <hi>Pompey</hi> was always proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous while he did no good, and all things were unſucceſſeful when he took up arms for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Country and defence of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like liberty. If therefore that great perſonage could be ſo ſcandaliſed at the Providence of God, what muſt we judge of them to whom nature had not given ſo great a capacity, nor ſo high a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or deep knowledge in Philoſophy &amp; even of that ſect which would be accounted the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious? Could it otherwiſe be, but that the leaſt accident of Fortune (as they ſpoke) falling out
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:119039:121"/> contrary to what humane Underſtanding judg'd fit and reaſonable, ſhould unſettle and tranſport their minds with amazement? And indeed, what were the opinions of the Philoſophers in thoſe dayes? Some maintain'd a fatal Neceſſity, ſuch as it were impoſſible to avoid; inferior cauſes being ſo connected by Deſtiny with the ſuperior, that not onely men could not reſiſt it, but the Gods themſelves were ty'd up by it: in like manner as <hi>Sarpedon</hi> dy'd in the War at <hi>Troy</hi> by the decree of Deſtiny, though his Father <hi>Jupiter</hi> had a vehement and ardent deſire of the contrary. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had ſometimes indevoured to prevent certain accidents by their induſtry and prudence, which Divine Providence that penetrates all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, did not ſuffer them to bring to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired end. Whence it came to paſs that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ignorance of man, and the invincible power of the Deity in executing its purpoſes, brought a contempt upon Providence. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be imagin'd that renders the Deity more ſubject to be contemn'd, or that more deadens the hopes of men upon all occaſions, then this fatal deſtiny, nor yet that renders them more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent in excuſing their enormities; witneſs that Varlet in the Comedian, who after a ſly trick which he had done, ſaid, <hi>It was the will of the Gods; and had they not decreed it, I could never have done it.</hi> Others obſerving that there fell out an infinite number of things in the world, of which no account could be given, nor the cauſes aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſuch effects, eſteemed that all went at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that God took no care of any thing. Yea ſometimes they expoſtulated the cauſe of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:119039:122"/> their calamities with the Deity, and complain'd that he took pleaſure in beating them down and bandying them to and fro. And the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Ancients are frequently ſtrewed with ſuch complaints, as ſo many blaſphemies and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of impiety, which their ignorance of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence caus'd them to utter. Beſides what I have recited above out of <hi>Claudian, Ovid,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Jaſon</hi> in <hi>Seneca</hi> the Tragedian beholding <hi>Medea</hi> fly away in the Air after ſhe had murder'd his children, ſaies to her,
<q>Teſtare nullos eſſe, qua veheris, Deos.</q> In <hi>Virgil,</hi> a mother that had loſt her Son by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature death, reviles the Deity,
<q>Atque Deos atque aſtra vocat crudelia mater.</q> And of this enough of other examples may be found, which have been collected by learned men. But if there have been ſome among the Pagans, who in theſe ſcandals have contained from blaſpheming (which were very rare in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of others) at leaſt it cannot be denyed but that in that ignorance of the cauſe that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the Univerſe, they were depriv'd of a great conſolation, being dubious and wavering in a perpetual perplexity, whether God took care or not of their Life and affairs. Now as much as the opinion of God's good will and vigilant care for the good and conſervation of men is rebated, ſo much without queſtion is defaulked from their piety towards him. And, whereas (as we ſhall
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:119039:122"/> ſee in its due place) man is by nature alienated from God, and extremely averſe and reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to be reduc'd to him how clear knowledge ſoever he ha's by his word of this wiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, how could thoſe doubts and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ever introduce him to an ingenious and free devotion? I conclude therefore that all the Religion of the Ancients, who liv'd without a particular Revelation, had there been no other particulars to make it ſo but this, was either lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid or forc'd; and that conſequently to beget in the hearts of men a true and ſince reſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God it is needful that himſelf inſtruct us in the knowledge of his Providence. But that which follows ſhall ſhew the ſame more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently.</p>

               <p>DEath is the moſt ordinary thing in the World; For all that are born muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily dye. Yet there is nothing of whoſe Cauſe and End Philoſophers have been more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. All of them look't upon it as a thing purely Natural, which befalls us as inevitably as naturally; becauſe our bodies being compoſed of the Elements which include diſcordant qualities, hot and cold, dry and moiſt, ſo long as theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in good harmony, and are mixed in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect temperature, they are maintained in vigor; but when one comes to prevail againſt another, or one of them fails through abſumption of the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in which it conſiſts, or any other way, there neceſſarily follows a diſſipation of the compages. Which happens in like manner to all other bodies which have the ſame principles of their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the union after a certain time being diſſolved and the bodies corrupted. Indeed if the Soul of Man were mortal as his body is, they would have reaſon for this opinion, and Death would be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to us as it is to other creatures: but it befits onely <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who believes the humane Soul
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:119039:123"/> corruptible, to hold Death for a thing ſimply na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, if every one will ſpeak agreeably to his principles, and not run into abſurdities and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances. For Man is not the Soul onely, he is the body to; that is to ſay, the body is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the caſe of his Soul wherein ſhe is included for a time, but a part of man, which enters into his compoſition, and without which he cannot be called man. Now what a diſorder is it in the Nature of man, that half of his eſſence ſhould be extinguiſh'd at the end of fourty or fifty years, and the other half, his Soul, remain for ever after deſpoiled of it? Unleſs the wild Metempſychoſis of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> be admitted, and that our Souls do not ceaſe to go out of ſome bodies, and re-enter into others, ſometimes into a horſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a bird, and ſometimes a man; or if it be confin'd onely to humane bodies, that he who was a great Philoſopher two thouſand years ago, is now a Cow-heard, and that great Prince who diſcomfited <hi>Darius</hi> neer the City of <hi>Arbela,</hi> at this preſent a Porter in the Market. An Opinion, I conceive, they againſt whom I diſpute will not own. Shall the Soul then, remain eternally a Widow? She, that cheriſhes the body ſo much, that ſhe forgets her own intereſt to be compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to it? She that is not ſeparated from it but with ſo great regret, that the beſt marriage in the world is not diſſolved with ſo much reluctancy and tears? In which reſpect, ſince theſe people acknowledge a Providence, how come they not to obſerve that if death be a thing purely natural, a good part of that Providence is loſt, death ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the body from its juriſdiction, ſo that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:119039:124"/> repay it the rewards of Virtue, nor make it feel any penalty for its Vices? Or if it be a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Body to exiſt no more, why do thoſe dy who in conſideration of their Virtue and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought to obtain ſome recompenſe for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? For the courſe of the World is ſuch, as we noted above, that in this life neither the greateſt part of crimes are ſutably puniſht, nor the leaſt part of compenſations diſtributed; and the Colicks, Megrims, Catarrhs, Palſies, Goutes, and Stone hinder us from boaſting of having found our corporeal beatitude here. Yea if death be a thing natural, as they conceive, it cannot be a puniſhment to the body for the Vices to which it is addicted. For that which is natural may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be an infirmity or miſery, but not a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which ha's no place but in retribution for ſin; and becauſe things which are purely natural arrive to us, whether we ſin or not. And beſides the Vicious would be no otherwiſe treated then he which is not ſo, and he that is not Vitious would have no better a condition then he that is culpable. Which perverts all order of Juſtice and all Wiſdom of Providence.</p>
               <p>But there daily falls out a certain accident in Life, of which, in caſe death be natural, noman can give a pertinent reaſon nor acquit the Providence which governs the world of blame. Namely that Infants dye at their birth, and even ſome are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd in the Womb. To what purpoſe were it to have lodg'd a Soul ſo little a time in a body, that it had not ſo much leaſure as to know its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation? And ſince, as they teach, 'tis the Soul it ſelf that faſhions and diſpoſes and contrives its
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:119039:124"/> manſion, why is it ruin'd before ſhe can enjoy it, without hope of ever ſeeing it re-edified. And as to the poor wretched body which is not yet ſenſible of its condition, what is it the better for having been ſo little a while, or what hath it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that it muſt be no longer? I know well that it is taught that it is better to Be then Not to be, and I do not gainſay it: but yet a Being of ſo little duration is of no great comfort: and he would ſeem not to ſatisfie right reaſon, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſk'd why he breaks an excellent piece of workmanſhip incontinently after he had made it, without having reap'd any uſe of it either to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or any other, ſhould anſwer that it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that he had given it a being of half an hour. For it was not to experiment his art that God framed little Infants; there are Proofs enough of that in ſo many millions of men; he knows it without tryal; and is ſo expert therein, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work of his being perfect, he ha's no cauſe to repent of or be diſpleaſed with it. If it be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that 'tis for the exerciſe of Parents to train them to patience; were there no more in it but this, the action indeed would have for its end to frame men to Virtue, in which their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with the Deity conſiſts; but the means that God uſed to bring them to it, would ſeem to carry ſomething of inhumanity, of which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous that he ſhould propoſe himſelf an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. God, who is ſo good, &amp; hath ſo many other means in his hand to lead men to Virtue, would never willingly employ any thereunto, for which he might be accus'd of barbarouſneſs and cruelty; eſpecially ſeeing it is an accident ſo frequent, that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:119039:125"/> in a Town of a thouſand families, there do's not paſs one day in the year in which it do's not happen. 'Tis true, for certain great and important conſiderations Kings are excuſed if they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times commit ſome act of injuſtice or violence. But this muſt be very rarely done, and onely when the ſafety of the State is concern'd. Yet <hi>Lucretia</hi> could not contain from crying out, upon the death of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> who was ſacrific'd for the ſafety of all <hi>Greece,</hi>
                  <q>Tantum Religio potuit ſuadere malorum!</q> But that there ſhould dye five or ſix times as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Children in the Cradle, as attain to mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, ſeems an irregularity which not onely an <hi>Epicurean,</hi> but the moſt devout and pious amongſt the Philoſophers cannot but judge unſupportable.</p>
               <p>Above all other conſiderations, the Fear which the thought of death begets naturally in all men deſerves our animadverſion. For how couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſo ever any may endevour to appear, 'tis as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls it, the moſt terrible of all terrors. And as one hath obſerved, if <hi>Julius C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſar,</hi> who was magnanimity it ſelf, ſaid that the moſt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected death was the ſweeteſt and moſt deſirable, which teſtifies that he reſented ſome dread when he thought of it, what may we think of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which other men have of it. And this Fear does not ariſe onely from the apprehenſion, that a man ſhall exiſt no more, but it hath ſomething of I know not what other violence and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For otherwiſe, nature and reaſon being two things which accord very well together, if
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:119039:125"/> death were purely natural, reaſon would finde ſomething in that conſideration wherewith to be comforted, and gently drink off that Cup. But experience ſhews that the conſolations taken from the neceſſity of Nature, and the example of ſo many other deaths, are too weak, and of too little efficacy, when the buſineſs is to ſtrengthen a ſoul that trembles at the preſence of death. Which if there have been ſome that were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly reſolv'd to undergo, they have been very few in number, and almoſt none in compariſon of ſo many men, yea Nations, to whom the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms of death have been terrible and hideous. For I do not put in the rank of ſuch as reſolve gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly againſt it thoſe Caitifs that tye the rope to their own necks, and drink to their companions upon the Ladder. For this is ſo far from true ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity conjoyn'd with the diſcourſe of reaſon, that it is meer ſtupidneſs and more then beſtial brutality. And it is diligently to be obſerved, that they who believe not that their Soul is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, comfort themſelves more eaſily then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do with the conſideration of the neceſſity of death, and ſay that as the Generations which preceeded their Birth belonged nothing at all to them, becauſe they were not yet in being, ſo they ought not to care for thoſe which follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death, in regard they ſhall be no longer; and that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> is dead, and <hi>Romulus,</hi> and <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and the <hi>Scipio's.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Qui multis quam tu meliores, improbe, rebus.</q>
               <p>And I believe the greateſt part of thoſe that have
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:119039:126"/> ſhewn ſo high a courage in contemning death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Pagans, had not much conſideration of their future condition. As it is clear by <hi>Socrates,</hi> who ſays, in <hi>Plato,</hi> that he knew not which was beſt to live or to dye, and that it were a folly to redoubt a thing of which there is no certain knowledge whether it be deſirable or to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whereas they that think ſeriouſly of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, find nothing in nature that encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages or comforts them. A ſure evidance that death hath ſomething of terror in it which does not proceed from nature, but from ſomething elſe: for they would at leaſt have more ground of conſolation then the others, in the ſubſiſtence of the better part of their eſſence. Now whence can that horror be, but onely that death is the forerunner of divine vengeance, and makes up a part of it already?</p>
               <p>If hereupon they agree that it is a puniſhment for ſin; certainly, ſince all other Philoſophers have held it to be ſimply natural, they cannot know it to be ſo by any other way then that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, that hath inform'd us by what gate it entred into the World. For none of the Ancients ever found out or could ſo much as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in a dream what was the cauſe of it. And ſo far were they from having it come into their minds, that on the contrary ſome have believed that Death was rather a gift and gratification to us from the Deity, then a puniſhment inflicted by his Juſtice. Which opinion the innumerable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of humane life greatly concurr'd to render authentick: the undergoing whereof being look'd upon as ſo dolorous, that ſometime the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:119039:126"/> from them ha's been accounted the greateſt good that could arrive. Or if ſome few have not dared to affirm abſolutely that death was a Good, yet they maintain'd at leaſt that it was no Evil, ſince it reſcues men from all calamities which they ſuffer. <hi>To fear death,</hi> ſaid <hi>Socrates</hi> to his Judges, <hi>is nothing elſe but to ſeem to be wiſe, and not to be ſo. For it is to pretend to know that which we do not know; becauſe none knows what death is, nor whether it be not the greateſt good that can befall a man.</hi> To which <hi>Plutark</hi> refers that exhortation of an ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Poet,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So alſo the greateſt part of the reflections of <hi>Cicero</hi> upon this matter in the firſt of the <hi>Tuſculane</hi> Queſtions fall into the Dilemma of <hi>Socrates;</hi> To wit, that if the ſoul be extinguiſh'd with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſo the ſenſe of all things be abſolutely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh'd, death cannot really be an Evil; becauſe a man being thereby wholly depriv'd of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and exempted from among the nature of things, that which is not, is equally incapable both of Evil and Good. But if the ſoul ſurvive the Body, death is ſo far from being an evil, that it ought rather to be accounted in the number of the greateſt goods; ſeeing it delivers from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of this preſent life, and puts a man in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the contentments of a better: upon which he does not omit to mention the converſe with the Heroes, wherein <hi>Socrates</hi> placed the greateſt part of the hopes of his joy. But the buſineſs is of higher importancy. For though the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:119039:127"/> ſhould have taught men that death is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the juſtice of God, yet is it impoſſible (as we ſhall ſee in due place) for the ſame to diſcover to them the remedy thereof. And I conceive, that though the reaſon of man ſhould have been able certainly to conjecture what the cauſe of death is, God himſelf would have purpoſely hid it from them, leaſt, not being able to diſcover the remedy of it, deſpair ſhould ſink and ruine all the World. All other ignorances have been prejudicial, and very often pernicious to men; to this alone we owe the conſervation of humane Society. So that we may pertinently apply to this in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that which <hi>Horace</hi> ſpeaks generally of the ignorance in which it hath pleaſed God we ſhould live, touching events to come;
<q>
                     <l>Prudens, futuri temporis exitum</l>
                     <l>Caliginoſa nocte premit Deus.</l>
                  </q> The ſole Word of God (which is the ſpecial reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation we are in queſt of) is that which accords all theſe differences, and clears up all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and confuſions. We ſhall not diſpute at preſent, whether in his firſt creation the body of man was naturally ſo well conſtituted, that through prudence whereby he was able to avoid all hurtful things, and the uſe of aliments (which the bleſſing of God rendred as efficacious for the conſervation of life by the good and pure qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which he at firſt indued them with, as now they are often full of noxious juices, ſince the curſe of God blaſted them for our offence) he might without other aſſiſtance from the Deity, avoid all alteration and corruption either by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:119039:127"/> or Age. God hath in the compoſure of Gold and Diamonds and other like things, given ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof of his power; and hath ſo exactly temper'd the contrary qualities of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the conſtitution of certain bodies, that they ſeem not ſubject to any corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoever. And the long life which the firſt Men liv'd, even after ſin, and the examples of the like we meet with in ſeveral profane Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſome alſo, though few, which may be found in the Hiſtories of theſe latter times, give us enough to judge how firm and durable the life of man would be, were he as exactly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fram'd, and the aliments that ſupport him as good, as the eſtate of Nature in its integrity could have promiſed. We onely affirm, that though, as the Philoſophers thought, the body of man being compoſed of the Elements, and conſequently including contrary and repugnant qualities, would have carried in its ſelf the ſeeds of death; yet this revelation teaches us that the Wiſdom of God would have ſo provided therein, that if no diſorder had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in the World through ſin, the propenſity which our bodies have to their own diſſipation, would have been reſtrain'd and hindred by his Providence. For he would have repell'd all ſorts of eternal accidents; he would have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the intemperature of the humors, both by preſerving them in right harmony, and ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man with aliments indued with excellent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and void of all noxiouſneſs; and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing new vigor of life in time of neceſſity, to hinder the approach of Old-age, would have
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:119039:128"/> maintained man in a vigorous and flouriſhing conſiſtence, and ſo given him the immortality, of which we have now nothing left but the deſire. Whence likewiſe the union of the Soul and Body would have continued to eternity, not ſubject to any important change or evil accident. So that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting death to be an accident that ſutes with the natural principles of the compoſition of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, yet the cauſe that they do dye is, becauſe it having been covenanted that the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a mortal condition ſhould be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred upon condition that man continued in obedience, ſin ſupervening hath changed the diſpenſation of all that, and effected that death is become in quality of a puniſhment and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. And this ought nor to be deemed ſtrange; For there are things which conſidered in themſelves have nothing ſo ſhameful in them, but that they may well endure either the preſence of another, or the publike day-light, which yet through the diſorder befallen in nature are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ignominious. Nakedneſs, which of it ſelf is not diſhoneſt, is become unſeemly through ſin, which hath cauſed rebellion in the corporeal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites againſt reaſon. So that they who affirm it indifferent to go naked or clothed, ſhew that extreme profaneſs hath worn out of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads that ſhame which cauſes others to expreſs their conſciouſneſs of ſin and the unſeemlineſs of the irregularity of our ſenſual faculties, ſo as to be aſham'd of their impudence who are not ſo themſelves. Wherefore though death were a natural accident, which yet it is not, the horror of it is too great, to acknowledge no more in it
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:119039:128"/> but pure nature and its motions. For why then do Infants dye? We learn from the ſame revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that that ſo ſudden ſeparation of the ſoul from the Body is not for ever: but that the being which is given them, though at firſt it ſeem's to have been allotted for a moment onely, and by conſequence little better then not-being, ſhall endure eternally, when the conſiderations ſhall ceaſe for which it ſuffer'd the Eclipſe of the time that it was to appear in this Life. For the being of man, when it hath once had a beginning, is of perpetual duration; and the time of Death is but as an Eclipſe of his courſe. But this is not the place for this diſcourſe, and therefore we ſhall add but a word more and paſs forward. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the juſtice or the goodneſs of God, this revelation amply furniſhes us what to anſwer in defence of both. He takes away lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children at their birth, and notwithſtanding does not incur thereby any blame of cruelty; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe before they were born they deſerved that puniſhment by reaſon of the natural infection of ſin which they drew from thoſe that begat them. And indeed as we cruſh the Eggs of Scorpions before they are hatcht, not becauſe they have as yet deſerved to be deſtroy'd for any wound which we have received by them, but becauſe in growing up, the ſeeds of venome which that brood hath by nature will infallibly be exerted to our miſchief; ſo is it ſometimes expedient for God to ſtifle from the wombe ſuch children as have ſo many ſeeds of vice in them, that coming to years would do much more miſchief then any Scorpion in the World. This the Philoſophers
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:119039:129"/> never underſtood, and therefore could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in anſwer: But if there opinion were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it would be requiſite to defer judging of the merit of Infants till they come to the age that ennables them to manifeſt and diſplay their Vice. Moreover God reſumes ſome of them back to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whom he pleaſes to render happy by his goodneſs. Nor is it neceſſary that he ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them a longer abode in this life, that ſo they might be capable of happineſs for their practiſes of Virtue: becauſe he do's not give it as a Salary deſerved from his juſtice by our Virtues, but as a beneficence purely out of his liberality: which likewiſe the Philoſophers never thought of; for according to them, if there remains any beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to be hoped after this Life, it cannot be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd unto but by Virtue. How then can Infants obtain the ſame which dye in the cradle, and ſo are prevented of ever exerciſing themſelves in Virtue? So great are the advantages of them which have this particular revelation above thoſe which reject it; to wit, that we know for what reaſon we dread death ſo much, and why it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be feared; what the ſources are from whence we are to draw our conſolations againſt its agonies; and laſtly what is the way to aſcribe glory always to the Deity, whatſoever accident happens in the World.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Corruption of Mankind; How much it imports true piety to know the Original of it: which we cannot do without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Revelation.</head>
               <p>THe excellence of the Nature of man is ſuch, that he cannot be conſidered either in his body or his mind, or in the dominion which he claims over all things, but there are preſented very eminent teſtimonies and tokens of it. The Stature of his body is comely and graceful; not deſpicable for its ſmallneſs, nor unſightly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious by too great bulk: the Symmetry of his members, his delicate ſkin, and tender fleſh, have an air ſo tranſcendently pleaſing that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animals may ſeem courſely compoſed, and made for laborious ſervices, but man alone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and deſigned for empire. Eſpecially in his countenance ſhines a majeſty, that ſpeaks him made to contemplate the heavens, no leſs then to command on earth. And whereas Brutes have their heads inclined downwards,
<q>
                     <l>Os homini ſublime dedit, coelumque tueri</l>
                     <l>Juſſit, &amp; erectos ad Sydera tollere vultus.</l>
                  </q> As for his Mind, the Sciences and Arts of which he is Author, the capacity to govern Societies
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:119039:130"/> and conduct Armies; the Dexterity of forming a deſign with underſtanding, and carrying on the ſame with prudence; of contriving the means induſtriouſly to their end, and guiding them thereunto by courſes that ſeem oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; the faculty of conceiving the Ideas of things which are not as if they were, although compounded of parts abſolutely diſcrepant; the ſagacity of knowing how to make uſe of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients for long Navigations, and tracing wayes in the Sea by direction of the Stars, are ſufficient proofs and evidences to evince its excellence. So that they are without compariſon more to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, who conceiv'd that the Spirit of Man was a ſmall particle deriv'd from the Deity, then they which reduc'd it to the condition of Beaſts. <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cylides</hi> had indeed ſome reaſon when he ſaid,
<q>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</q> As if God in creating man, and indowing him with ſo divine an underſtanding, had lent him a little portion of his eſſence. In like manner, the Empire which he hath over all other creatures ſhews ſufficiently, that it is not for nothing that his mind and body have been indued with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eminent qualifications above all other things. The Earth produces for him the neceſſities and pleaſures of life to his contentment, and like a ſoveraign he employs its ſtones, marbles &amp; metals to build his palaces, and guild the roofs which he makes of its Cedars. He covers himſelf with the wool of animals, and inſects ſpin ſilk for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Notwithſtanding his own weakneſs he
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:119039:130"/> ranks Elephants in battel, and makes them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his paſſions without their knowing that they are ſo. He hath put the bridle in the mouth of Horſes, and tamed that proud and fierce ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal for his convenience. Even the life of poor beaſts is nothing to him for his ſuſtenance; and how terrible ſoever the Sea be, yet he hath found out means to fail upon it ſecurely, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn nations by commerce, whom vaſt diſtances of Oceans have divided.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all this, his corruption appears ſo manifeſtly, that there is none but ha's obſerv'd it. For one comely and perfectly well compoſed perſon, there will ever be found a hundred that have ſomewhat of difformity. There are always ſome impotent and leſs-favoured by nature, ſome one-ey'd and lame, and even ſome perſons born to Kingdomes, whoſe ſtructure and conformation of members is pitiful or ridiculous. We are ſubject to ſo many diſeaſes, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one ſingle perſon ſuffers more of them in his life then all other animals together of a whole province.</p>
               <p>The corruption of his Mind is extremely great. Not to ſpeak at preſent of that ignorance which is common to all, and the moſt knowing complain of with good reaſon; although it may ſeem that man having been made to ſerve himſelf with all things, he ought at leaſt to know them: The Evil which he commits both againſt others and himſelf, hath given occaſion to One hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay, That as it were better to give no wine to ſick perſons, becauſe if it profits one, it hurts more; ſo it would have been better not to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:119039:131"/> have allow'd man the uſe of reaſon, ſince for one good that it does, it cauſes ten thouſand e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in the World. There are nothing but Wars of Nation againſt Nation, yea of the ſame Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in its own bowels. In Cities there are ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in families tumults; The Huſband and Wiſe do not accord in the ſame bed, whoſe ſouls notwithſtanding ought to be cemented together. And that which is more ſtrange: every one is not at agreement with himſelf, our natural inſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diſquiets us, our paſſions turmoile us, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and jealouſies fret and devour us; and which is a lively token of our corruption, in what condition ſoever we be, I do not ſay tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable onely, but even honorable and deſirable by others, we are never contented with it. That which a while ſince we ardently deſired, we ſoon after deſpiſe; and what we made no account of when we injoy'd, we reſent its loſs with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; thus condemning our own judgement of error, frequently with remorſe for ſuffering our ſelves to be tranſported with paſſion and appetite. Witnes that excellent Satyre of <hi>Horace,</hi> in which he introduces old ſoldiers complaining that they are not Merchants, and Merchants envying the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the military life. The Lawyer there extolls the tranquillity and peace of the Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who alſo eſteems himſelf miſerable in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thoſe that dwell in Cities. So that whether it be chance, or the wiſh and choice of reaſon, that puts men upon their courſe of life, yet there is not one but finds ſomething to diſlike in his own, and repines that he is not well at eaſe, nor ſo favourably treated as his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:119039:131"/> And notwithſtanding, were a proffer ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to exchange conditions: and the Merchant ſent to the Campe, and the Soldier to traffick at Sea; as alſo were the Huſbandman become a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, and engaged in the toileſome affairs of Law-Courts, and the Lawyer oblig'd to drive the Waine, there is none of them but would aſmuch diſapprove the change. Laſtly we need not much exalt our ſelves for the Dominion which we have over other things; for the Earth produces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but with the labor of our armes and ſweat of our brows, and beſides recompenſes us oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with bryars and thiſtles. The Froſt and Mill-dew blaſt our Vines and Corn, the Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piller and Locuſt devour our hopes; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of animals againſt us is ſuch, that we are put to defend our ſelves even againſt vermine, not onely againſt Serpents, Dragons, Lyons and Tygers. Whence it is come to paſs that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients were ſo inconſtant in the judgement which they made of man and his nature. For after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoken ſo much to his advantage that the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of King and God ſometimes was not ſufficient for him, who can but wonder at <hi>Jupiters</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in <hi>Homer</hi> for having given <hi>Peleus</hi> horſes to become partakers of humane miſery, where he ſays that man is ſubject to more miſeries then any other animal upon the face of the Earth.</p>
               <p>So ſome wept upon the birth of their children through compaſſion that they come into this Scene of troubles, and laught upon the death of their Parents, out of joy that they go out of it; and <hi>Euripides</hi> ſays that we ought to do ſo. In a word, the moſt uſual comfort which they took in death,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:119039:132"/> is that it puts an end to our miſeries; and their hiſtories, or fables, affirm that it was ſent as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Gods to the greateſt and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſons in recompenſe of their Virtues: as to <hi>Cleobis</hi> and <hi>Biton,</hi> for their piety towards <hi>Juno;</hi> to <hi>Agamedes</hi> and <hi>Trophonius,</hi> for their pains in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to <hi>Pindar.</hi> What therefore can we ſay that man is? In truth, conſidering mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it cannot be better reſembled then to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is but as the carkaſs of what it was of old. There are remaining indeed ſome ruins, and ſome old inſcriptions not-intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, ſome fragements of ancient Statues, and defaced monuments and ponderous tombes ſince the time ſhe was Empereſs of the World. But in the whole all this is of ſo little proportion, that had we no other knowledge of her grandeur by hiſtories, it were as impoſſible to conjecture thereby what ſhe was fifteen hundred years ago; as it is to gueſs at the integrity that flouriſh'd in the firſt ages by the manners of the preſent times.</p>
               <p>Now of the cauſe and origine this ſo deplorable ruine all the ancients both Poets and Philoſophers have been ignorant; all their conjectures thereof are dubious and unreſolved, and all their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors falſe. Nor is it difficult to judge how much this ignorance hath hindred them from rendring to God what belongs to him upon this account, and taſting any true and ſolid conſolations in their miſeries. For how could they acknowledg his juſtice in the puniſhment of mankind, whilſt they knew not that this diſorder hapned by their
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:119039:132"/> own fault? How could they admire his goodneſs in conſervation of the Univerſe, when they were ignorant that man deſerv'd to be reduced to nothing from his birth? How could they have recourſe to God for obtaining of him a remedy againſt ſuch miſery, ſeeing they knew him not; or how could they beſeech him to repair their ruins? How could they learn not to murmure againſt him, if they knew not that the evils they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered were worthily inflicted on them, and as due to their crimes? Laſtly, how could they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain themſelves from ſuſpecting the wiſdom or power of him that governs the World, while they were ignorant of any pertinent reaſon of all this diſorder. For as when we obſerve in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth good and bad laws, and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unſeemly cuſtomes mixed together, we conclude that either the firſt Legiſlators failed in ſome particular things, though they hapned right in others, or that later Magiſtrates degenerated from the Wiſdom and Virtue of their Anceſtors: ſo beholding order and confuſion jumbled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the World, it remains onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that either the wiſdom of him that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived it at the beginning was defective, or that he could not ſupport and maintain his ancient laws through want of power. I mention not at preſent the natural avidity of knowledge in us, which can be little ſatisfied without a particular revelation, as in other abſtruſe things, ſo in this which is of ſuch moment, and continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to our minds, namely, what ſhould be the cauſe of ſo many evils that reign in the World.</p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:119039:133"/>
               <p>In the next place the conſolations which they employ againſt them are very ſtrange. Some comfort themſelves with the conſideration of neceſſity; againſt which it is unprofitable to ſtruggle. And indeed I deny not, but it is good counſel to give to ſuch as are miſerable, that when there is no means of deliverance from calamity, to indevor at leaſt to ſupport it with the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience that may be, becauſe neceſſity is invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. It is good, I ſay, if it could be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. But as he that ſhould exhort a man that is in the paroxyſm of a violent Colick, to be cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, would ſhew himſelf ridiculous and void of underſtanding; ſo he that ſhould counſel a man fallen into ſome great and irrecoverable diſtreſs, to comfort himſelf becauſe it cannot be otherwiſe, would deſervedly be accounted troubleſome and almoſt barbarous. Can any imagine that it would have been any great heartning to the poor <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetes,</hi> when he made the Sea and rocks reſound his lamentable ejulations, and wiſh'd that ſome body would caſt him down from the precipice of a rock into the waves beneath, for one to have ſaid to him, Friend, there is no remedy, Deſtiny will have it ſo; and to wraſtle againſt her decree is to ſwim againſt the ſtream? For this is the cauſe of his deſpair, that there is no remedy: were there any hope of it, he would not cry out ſo loud, but ſuſtain himſelf with thoſe excellent words of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> If pain be great, it will be but of ſhort durance. And it would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in ſuch a caſe for a man to boaſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible ſtrength of his courage. <hi>Hercules</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf groan'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd cry'd out in the midſt of the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:119039:133"/> flames. In effect, there is no conſtancy, which the aſſiduous perſeverance of pain do's not at length overcome. Nature ha's not made us of Iron or Steel; but hath given us a tender and delicate fleſh, and quick and lively ſentiments. In a word, the conſideration of Neceſſity may indeed cauſe a man to reſolve to travel through a bad and dirty way, or to ſwallow a bitter potion that is ſoon down; but there is no conſtancy which is not undermined and worn out by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſuffering. Others have ſolac'd themſelves with the commonneſs &amp; generality of the miſery conceiving it both injuſtice and folly, for any particular perſon to complain of his own caſe, where all are equally involv'd: As the Proverb hath it, <hi>'Tis the comfort of ſufferers to have compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Thus the Poet <hi>Antimachus</hi> compos'd an Elegy, wherein he reckon'd up all the diſaſters befallen to any people that ever he knew, to comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the loſs of his wife. But as the Sun, though he ſhines in common to all that have eyes, yet his light ought not to be accounted leſs grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſweet; and as the uſe of reſpiration is not leſs neceſſary, becauſe all animals equally breath the air: So the condition of unhappy perſons is not leſs painful and grievous, by being common to all, nor the ſentiment of great calamities more light by ſeeing others groan under the ſame misfortunes. Beſides, this kind of conſolation ſeems to me to have ſomething of barbariſm and inhumanity in it. If it happen to any one to be condemned to the Gibbet, either juſtly or unjuſtly, is it meet for him to deſire to behold other of his compatriots executed with him for the diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:119039:134"/> of his unhappineſs? It was a thing which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted <hi>Phocion</hi> at his condemnation to death, that he had fellow-ſufferers; his great humanity inducing him to wiſh, that if poſſible that heavy ſentence might have fallen onely upon his own perſon.</p>
               <p>But they may ſeem to have had more reaſon who comforted themſelves with the hope of death, that would put an end to all things. Yet who ſees not that this was but the conſolation of deſperate people? For what difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a man that deſires death through impatience of his pain, and him that kills himſelf; ſaving that one ha's more courage, or is tranſported with greater deſpair then the other? Death is naturally accounted an Evil, and even by moſt men the greateſt of all Evils; nor is there any ſhame or pain but they will undergo for preſerving their Lives, even ſo far as to ſuffer the mutilation of their arms and legs. <hi>Cut off my feet, and after that my leggs</hi> (ſaid <hi>Mecoenas) and my thighs alſo, if you pleaſe. Provided I do but live, tis enough.</hi> What kind of conſolation then can that be which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſo much abhorr'd? And how great muſt their miſery be, who place all their comfort in that which is naturally abhorr'd? Muſt not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have reduc'd us to a deplorable extremity, when there remains no other comfort for us, but ſuch as theirs is, who being ſtretcht forth on the Wheel on a Scaffold, are told that their ſentence is mitigated onely to be hanged? But yet they which think of the immortality of their Souls, cannot comfort themſelves by all theſe means, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be well perſwaded of the pardon of their
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:119039:134"/> ſins which have drawn all theſe miſeries upon them. For if they indure ſo great evils in this life for their offenſes, what can they expect in the other? Certainly we ſee for the moſt part, ſuch a perſon that deſired death through impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his pain, timerouſly ſlinks from it when he ſees it approaching, and would bargain with any body that could make his Gouts laſt for fifty years.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there have been ſome that would draw matter of glory from humane miſeries, and who held that they were the tryals of Virtue, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming it beſt for a man to indure evil, becauſe otherwiſe he can have no knowledg of Patience, which is the moſt excellent virtue of all. One ſuffered himſelf to be brayed in pieces without groaning, and another in the violent fits of the Stone, ſaid, <hi>Do thy worſt, Pain, yet I ſhall never confeſs that thou art evil.</hi> But in truth this is a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh wiſdom; this Indolence, as <hi>Plutark</hi> ſays, is not bought but at the price of brutality. To be a Philoſopher of this faſhion, a man muſt put off all humane paſſions, and be converted into a Stone. As if it were not natural to man to ſigh and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and when he is wraſtling with an extreme pain, to wiſh his deliverance. But yet thoſe are greater fools, who find cauſe of pride and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their ſuffering. Is it ſuch a cordial chearing to a man who ha's the Colick, Gout, Megrim, or Tooth-ache; who is afflicted with poverty, ſhame and contempt of the World; who hath lewd children that threaten the Gallows; that is oppreſs'd and tyrannis'd by great adverſaries; hated, tormented, perſecuted and reviled by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:119039:135"/> for one to come and tell him that his pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tient ſuffering of all this will acquire great glory to him in the world? Certainly if the glory and the ſorrow were weigh'd one againſt another, I conceive there is no man of ſenſe and that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to all theſe evils, but would give all the glory which <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> had both together, to be delivered from them.</p>
               <p>The moſt ordinary conſolation (as we touched above) hath been to reproach and accuſe God and Nature, which they affirmed was a good mother to other Creatures, but to man an incompaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Stepdame; thus adding impietie to miſery. And they have been even ſo fooliſh, as to conceit that the greateſt part of our miſchiefs proceed from I know not what malevolence in the Deity, as if he bare a hatred or envy either to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or to the proſperity of men.

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Remiſſion of Sins; What knowledge men naturally have thereof; And how much it is the intereſt of true Piety to he aſſured of the ſame. Alſo, Of the Reſurrection of the Body.</head>
               <p>WE have proved above againſt the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> that there is ſuch a difference between Vice and Virtue, that it is not Places, or Times, or Laws of Magiſtrates, or Cuſtomes of Nations that renders the one commendable, and the other worthy of blame; but their proper nature and eſſence, which abides eternally equal and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. We alſo ſhewed conſequently, that as the recompenſe of goodneſs is congruous to virtue, ſo vice ha's a due right to puniſhment. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, what is the meaning of all thoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of conſcience, which we ſhew'd above to be natural to men? And to what end were the Providence of God himſelf? Who ſhould have taken the rewards of Virtue out of one of his hands, and the arms of vengeance againſt Vice out of the other? Wherefore I take it now for granted; beſides that though I had not proved it, yet they with whom I treat at preſent, do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out longer diſpute yield it. So that I ſhall paſs directly to ſpeak of the Remiſſion of Offenſes which merit that puniſhment, and of what great
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119039:136"/> concernment it is in order to being truely Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous towards God, to know by what meanes to obtain it, and get full aſſurance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Now there are onely four motives which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to piety and Virtue. The firſt is that of which alone the <hi>Epicureans</hi> boaſt they make any account, namely, the knowledge of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Deity; to which muſt be conjoyned (though it agrees not with the principles of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> who places the Supreme Good of man in Pleaſure) the knowledge of the natural honeſty which is in things, and which is lovely and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be followed for its own ſake. The ſecond is the ſenſe of benefit we receive and profit that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues from both the one and the other. For when we are favour'd by the Deity with ſome great beneficence, we ought earneſtly to be incited to honor him in acknowledging the ſame. The third is the hope of obtaining ſome compenſation for being Virtuous and exerciſing piety. And the fourth is the fear of incurring his indignation, by failing in the reſpective duties of Piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. As for the firſt of theſe motives, we have already ſhewn, that unleſs God reveal himſelf in an eſpecial manner, men live in a profound igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his nature and his excellence; in which reſpect it cannot be of much force to excite men to piety. And the caſe of the ſecond is the ſame. For although the goodneſs of God be in infinite maners extended towards men, in their creation, and the conſervation of their being, and in ſuch an admirable variety of things which he hath created for their uſe; yet ſo it is that none of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:119039:137"/> ha's ever acknowledged the ſame as is meet, nor indeed could they, as ſhall more amply ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Concerning the hope of recompenſe (not in this life ſurely, unleſs very ſcantly and after a faſhion that does not correſpond to the infinite goodneſs which is in God, but in another) all that men can have of it by the light of nature is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably drawn from the conſideration of the benefits which good men receive in this Life, from whence to argue, that he will enlarge his bounty in that which is to come. But divers things hinder a man from being able of himſelf to take from thence a certain argument for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For beſides that thoſe benefits conſiſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in temporal and frail things, and that it is hard for a carnal man to conjecture by them of eternal and ſpiritual benedictions, they are blended with ſo many calamities, with which our Life is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually perſecuted, that a man can ſcarce clearly behold the goodneſs of God through the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his juſtice, unleſs he bring a very great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention thereunto; and we on the contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them very negligently. As therefore when a Prince checks and ſtrikes as much or oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then he careſſes, it is hard to be aſſured of his good will, or to hope great favors from him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs one hath a moſt intimate knowledge of his nature and his counſels, and diligently weigh his actions and their circumſtances, his words and geſtures, thereby to ſee to the bottom of his thoughts: ſo man being naturally ſo negligent in conſidering the ways of the Deity, in the medly of effects of his juſtice and his goodneſs which appears in the whole conduct of the Univerſe,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:119039:137"/> cannot without doubt but have all his cogitations and reflections thereupon confuſed &amp; unſteddy. Is there ſo much as one to be found in an Age, that ſets himſelf to contemplate the benefits which God hath conferr'd on him, from thence to conceive an aſſurance for the future, and behold the light of his favour through the darkneſs and death. His Underſtanding is naturally too weak-ſighted; there are too many things in the world which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it, too many affections in it that faſten it to the Earth. But principally becauſe there is nothing ſo ſuſpicious as a bad conſcience, man well knowing his own great inclination to things diſpleaſing to the Deity, and even to the ſlighting of his honor and ſervice; his conſcience hinders him from hoping any thing from the goodneſs of God, and objects to it ſelf only his vengeance. So that the knowledge of Gods benefits towards men being ſo obſcure and dubious in them, and on the other ſide the ſenſe of their own demerit ſo quick and lively, they cannot but be poſſeſs'd with a great meaſure of fear, without almoſt any hope at all. Now if the hope of obtaining recompenſe by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God be none at all, or as good as none at all, the piety alſo will be none which uſes to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſuch hope. But there remains fear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; which is that alone which, to ſpeak clearly, ha's induc'd men that have had no other guide in his ſervice but reaſon, to addreſs to him devotion after their own faſhion (as <hi>Statius</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in this ſentence,
<q>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:119039:138"/>Primus in orbe Deos fecit timor)</q> which we will undertake to examine. By <hi>fear</hi> in the preſent diſcourſe, I do not underſtand a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence ariſing from conſideration of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of him before whom a man preſents himſelf, which when he does not find himſelf guilty of any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fence committed againſt him, may be conjoyned with a cordial love. For a thing that is excellent, great, and adorable of it ſelf, naturally cauſes fear, <hi>&amp; fa tremar altrui di Maraviglia,</hi> as the Poet <hi>Petrark</hi> ſpeaks, makes the ſpectators tremble with aſtoniſhment. But this is no impediment to a violent love and a calme aſſurance in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But I underſtand that ſort of fear which ſprings from the ſenſe of a mans own vitiouſneſs, and from the knowledge of a vengeance which he foreſees will follow. Now the Nature of this fear is ſuch, to ſpeak generally, that the greater it is, the leſs there is of hope to eſcape puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and likewiſe leſs love then ought to be had for him whoſe indignation and choler we dread. For as the old Poet ſaies in <hi>Cicero, Quem odimus, periiſſe cupimus.</hi> And this is peculiarly verified when things ſtand in ſuch termes as they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and mankind; namely when he that fears, takes ſupreme pleaſure in the things by which he deſerved the puniſhments he is afraid of: So that inſtead of renouncing his vice by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he would not have ſo much as the leaſt deſire of amendment enter into his ſoul, ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is it to him to be deprived of the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he receives in the ſatlating of his
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:119039:138"/> luſts. As a diſſolute youth hates his Maſter to the death that ſcourges him for his debaucheries; or as a Thief that hates the Magiſtrate far more, for cauſing a Gibet to be prepared for him to puniſh his robberies. Wherefore man being corrupt and a ſinner, as every one is convinc'd in his own conſcience, and not doubting (however other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ignorant) but that God is ſevere and juſt; it muſt neceſſarily be (things being judged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the motions of Nature) that inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attracted to piety by Fear, he will rather be induc'd thereby to diſclaim it wholly; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being inflamed with the love of God, his fear will give him ſtrong averſions againſt him, and poſſeſs him with hatred. But which is more, the leſs hope there is of obtaining his pardon, the leſs alſo is the care to reform his wickedneſſes. For Vice being full of baits and pleaſure, who is he that will deprive himſelf of a preſent good and that is in his hand, without hoping that his ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will turn to ſome benefit or advantage to him? Every one without queſtion chooſes rather to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace the fear of evil to come, by preſent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; which leſſen the bitterneſs of fear accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rate that they produce delight. So that if a man hopes to drown his fear abſolutely in the pleaſures of ſin, he takes no care but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his luſt, and take his ſwinge without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. And on this manner are formed the moſt part of thoſe Atheiſts ſo diſorderly in all their comportments; who having felt the terror of Gods wrath, have on purpoſe plung'd themſelves into drunkenneſe, uncleanneſs, and all other ſorts of horrible diſſoluteneſs, to divert the ſame
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:119039:139"/> out of their minds. So that by the cuſtome of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have ſo worn out the ſentiment of the Deity in them, and are by degrees become ſo hardened, that they have ſcarce leſt the leaſt ſparke of fear in their conſcience. It is true that ſometimes (as a drunkard will ſtart up out of his ſleep at the ſounding of an alarm) when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals his juſtice in an extraordinary maner, theſe monſters of men apprehend ſome ſentiment of terror. But as when the Cry is over the drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard falls down again on his pillow, and betakes himſelf to his former ſnoring; ſo the perill is no ſooner paſs'd in which theſe people found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they return to their accuſtomed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the means to withdraw men from ſin, when they are once awaked with the fear of vengeance, is the hope of pardon; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to appear, excites repentance, and with that the love of him from whom favour is hoped. But what can that hope be in this calamitous eſtate of our nature, if God himſelf do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the occaſion of it? Can a man finde it in the Heaven, or in the Earth, or in himſelf? What argument is there to be had of any from all theſe things on which he may build a certain aſſurance? Perhaps it will be objected, that by the ſame ways whereby we know the Juſtice of God, to wit, by the conſideration of his judgements, we may come to the knowledge of his goodneſs, namely, by the experience he affords of his benefits which he powres down ſo liberally upon men. Which I readily concede, and ſhall add this further, that ſince men have ſinn'd from the beginning and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:119039:139"/> the memory of all time, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their continual offenſes God does not ceaſe to do good to them, there may an argument be drawn from thence, that God invites men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; Now he would not invite them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, unleſs there were hope of pardon for them; for he does not mock or illude us: but all his actions are ſerious. Therefore God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us in the government of the World with grounds to believe that he is juſt, in exerciſing judgement upon the wicked; and good alſo, in extending his beneficencies towards the good; and merciful, in doing good even to ſuch as are wicked: and right reaſon is able to diſcern him ſuch in following him by theſe traces. But there are motions in the corrupt nature of man which fruſtrate the effect, if God did not provide for it after another manner. For man flyes from the preſence of God through fear of puniſhment, and cannot hinder the prevalence thereof in his Soul; ſo that as a man affrighted beholds nothing ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but always imagines new occaſions of terror, and repreſents hideous phantaſmes to himſelf; ſo we are not able to allow our ſelves leaſure to conſider attentively this diſpenſation of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God towards the Wicked, nor thereby to aſſure our ſelves of obtaining mercy and pardon. As a lewd wretch, whoſe conſcience bears him witneſs of many hainous crimes, though he ſhould perceive ſome connivence in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate for a time, and his judge ſhew him ſome good countenance, cannot but be diſtruſtful of him, and ſuſpect that he dos but differr his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till another time, and aſſuredly reſerve it
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:119039:140"/> for him; Eſpecially, if he hath an opinion that the Magiſtrate is not ſuch a one as himſelf, but abhors the wickedneſſes committed by him. Now we are univerſally thus principled, that as we hate thoſe whom we feat, ſo we never bear good will towards them of whom we have ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And the diſtruſting the goodwil of anyone being a ſtep to fear, is likewiſe by the ſame reaſon a degree to hatred; unleſs the diſtruſt proceed to ſuch a meaſure as to be an abſolute fear, for then the coldneſſe of affection is turned into perfect hatred. Wherefore Man thus diſtruſting the good will of God towards him, conſequently can have but a very ſlight affection to him; yea he will even become his enemy, inaſmuch as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt in this caſe cannot but be extremely great.</p>
               <p>But perhaps it will here be demanded, Whence then came it to paſs that all Nations have each of them had its Religion? And why are not all men diſſociated inſtead of liguing together in a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Society? To which I anſwer, that the mind of man is not ever agitated with the ſame emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor conſtant in the ſame thoughts; the ſame paſſion not always poſſeſſing him, nor the ſame vice. They take their turns, and ſuccede or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle one with another. Two things therefore have hindred that men though poſſeſs'd with fear, have not abandon'd all ſervice of the Deity; Profaneſs, and Pride: God permitting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſs of ſome and the preſumption of others to temper the terror of conſcience. Firſt profaneſs; becauſe not weighing ſufficiently how much God abominates Vice, and how inexorable his juſtice is, they often have flatter'd themſelves with this
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:119039:140"/> thought, that he ſcarce takes any notice of ſmall offenſes, and ſuch as are in the intention and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe onely, that is, in the affections of the will and not in actions really executed. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they thought that he was not much incenſed but with crimes that turn to ſome notable detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Commonwealth, or carry ſome blot of infamous improbity; although maſculine luſt was either juſtified, or excuſed or tolerated by the moſt civilis'd people of <hi>Greece.</hi> And they were ſometimes ſo beſotted in their devotions, that they thought not but crimes of the greateſt turpitude might with no great difficulty be expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their ſacrifices, luſtrations, religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, myſteries, and Bacchanal ſolemnities. On the other ſide Preſumption; becauſe not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently acknowledging how much they ought to the Deity, they imagin'd that their good works, their offerings, and the exerciſe of that ſhadow of Virtue which they purſued, might countervale the offenſes they committed: ſo that if they were balanc'd together, there might be hope not onely to avoid puniſhment, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to obtain recompenſe. Upon which ground it was that <hi>Socrates</hi> being near his end, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of the immortality of the Soul, ſpeaks largely of his hope (in caſe the Soul be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſht with the body) to go and live with <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> and <hi>Palamedes</hi> and the other perſons of high account. But as to aſking God pardon of the offenſes, he had committed, he makes no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all of it; becauſe though he ſpoke always diſſemblingly of himſelf, he had in the bottom of his Soul a great opinion of his own Virtue, and made
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:119039:141"/> no great reckoning of his vices, from which notwithſtanding he was no more exempt then others. And had his life been of ſuch purity, that the eyes of men could not diſcern a blot in it (although ſome have written infamous matters of him) yet when the account is to be made up with God, there needs an other perfection of Virtue then that of his, to ſatisfie ſo exact a juſtice. But yet further. Oftentimes theſe two Vices of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſs and Preſumption have met together in the ſame ſubject, and lull'd men with vain hopes into abſolute ſupinity. Whence the exceſs of Fear hath been retrenched, which would otherwiſe have at laſt turn'd into deſpair, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not only diſſipated all communion in Religion, but likewiſe ruined all humane Society. For Fear reſtraining man on the one ſide from abſolute contemning the Deity by profaneſs, on the other ſide profaneſs and preſumption hinder'd it from precipitating men into that furious deſpaire which would have overthrown all, and caus'd more horrible agitations in the mind of man, then ever the moſt outragious <hi>Bacchides</hi> were ſenſible of. So that by the mixture, viciſſitude &amp; variation of theſe divers humors ha's Religion been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the World. But it is eaſie to judge how ſincere that devotion was, which was bred of Fear (a paſſion that is naturally terminated in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred) Self-preſumption, and Miſapprehenſion of the juſtice of God. Whereas the certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the remiſſion of Sins, of which the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial revelation from Heaven can onely give us aſſured hope, is a marveillous powerful attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to piety, out of gratitude towards ſo ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable a goodneſs.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:119039:141"/>
               <p>But if the Ancients, both Poets and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were ſo much at a loſs concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding particulars, that they extremely needed ſome other light then that of nature, to direct them to a firm knowledge of them, they have been much more uncertain in the point of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead; of which they have been ſo far from determining any thing, that ſcarce ſo much as a ſlight ſhadow of it ha's been diſcerned by ſome few in ſo many Ages. The <hi>Stoicks,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, were of opinion that there would come a day that ſhould turn the Univerſe into flames, which ſhould be incontinently follow'd with a reſtauration of all things into their ancient eſtate. And others thought, that after a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of time, the Stars being returned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely to the point in which they were when all things began to be, all ſhould be renewed, every thing returning again in its order, time, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And one <hi>Theopompus,</hi> according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Diog. Laertius,</hi> affirmed that by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Magi,</hi> who were Philoſophers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> all men muſt revive again one day, and become immortal.

After which firſt there muſt alſo be another burning of the world, and another Palingeneſie or renovation of things. And ſo to all eternity, the world ſhould after certain revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions be conſumed by fire, and like the Phaenix ariſe again out of its own aſhes. But if this muſt be done perpetually for the future, I ſee not why it ſhould not have been done from all eternity hertofore; ſo that there have been already infinite
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:119039:142"/> worlds, and infinite more are yet to come: which beſide the contradictions that a knowing Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher finds in ſo many infinite things exiſting actually and ſo ſucceſſively ſome after others, is ſtrangely extravagant and abſurd to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. Moreover, what piety is that which this opinion begat in the minds of them that held it, that thought it thus determined by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable neceſſity of Deſtiny? For according to them God ſhall have no hand in the matter; but the ſame deſtiny that ſhall carry all things to their period when they are conſumed by that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conflagration, ſhall likewiſe give new being to all things. Now there is no obligation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thanks to God nor to acknowledge his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for being reſtored into being by the might of deſtiny, over which God hath no power. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs men are ſo wedded to their own opinions (howſoever extravagant) that there being <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> at the time of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching there (for as for the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> it was no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they called him a Babler) and the Stoicks being a Sect to whom the doctrine of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and univerſal judgement ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, as bringing much light to their own Tenets, yet there were few or none that receiv'd it. Some (ſaith the Hiſtorian) derided it and others deſired more ſatisfactory information of the thing. And yet of how great importance is it to true piety to be fully aſſured of this truth? For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how ſhall the goodneſs of God, which we have abundantly ſhewn is the liberal rewarder of Virtue, render to the body the free recompenſe of the ſervice it hath done the Soul in the practiſe
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:119039:143"/> thereof, and of the obedience which its natural appetites have yielded to reaſon, unleſs it be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again from the duſt? Certainly, as we ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, man is not onely the Soul, he is the body alſo; both which contribute reſpectively to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, of which man is capable. Wherefore they ought both to be intereſted in the reward. And that juſtice, which is the avenger of ſin, and without which the Providence of God would be too narrow and defective, how will that acquit its charge unleſs it equally puniſh the body with the ſoul? Seing they are uſually the affections of the body that debauch the mind, and 'tis the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſenſes that prevents and miſguids our reaſon. But the puniſhment would not be equally proportioned and diſtributed to the Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if the ſoul were miſerable to eternity, and the body wholly exempted from it to exiſt no more. And the condition of the body would be happy in compariſon of that of the mind, although the defect of both were equal. Moreover the penalty encreaſing proportionably to the dignity of him againſt whom the offenſe is committed (for an outrage done to an inferior perſon is puniſht otherwiſe then that which is committed againſt a Soverain Magiſtrate) the juſtice of God being an infinite power, an immenſe and unlimited dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and authority, how could the puniſhment of the body, by being no more, be proportional to the juſtice of God? Or if the juſtice of God can be ſatisfied for the offenſe committed againſt it, with the extinguiſhment of the body without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival to perpetuity, why is not the ſoul alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſht with the body without remaining ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:119039:143"/> to a continual and perpetual puniſhment? Certainly it muſt either be that the body ſuffers with the ſoul eternally for ſatisfaction of the juſtice of God ſutably to his infinite dignity, or the ſoul muſt be extinguiſh'd together with the body. But neither the juſtice of the God, nor the nature of the ſoul ſuffers the ſame to periſh or be aboliſh'd, and therefore the body muſt be raiſed from death to partake of the ſame compenſation with it. Moreover of how great importance is it for conſolation of our minds againſt the fear of death? For death being naturally terrible to all men, and the ſeparation of the ſoul from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy full of bitterneſs and anguiſh, what more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual comfort can be received, then to expect after a peaceable repoſe in the grave to be raiſed by the hand of God from it, not to reſtore us the injoyment of this life, that ſo we might dye over again, but to live an eternal life in unexpreſſible contentment? Beſides, what ſweeter conſolation in the loſs of our friends, which is oftentimes more grievous to us then death it ſelf, then the hope that they and we ſhall one day ariſe from the earth to dwell together in celeſtial glory? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he that repreſents to himſelf what joy friends receive here, upon an unexpected meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after divers years abſence, may in a manner conjecture with what gladneſs we ſhall reſent the day of that happy reſurrection. Whence I conceive that, excepting the aſſurance of pardon of ſins, which delivers the ſoul it ſelf from the apprehenſions of death eternal, there is nothing ſo capable of inflaming the mind of man with love towards God, as the hope of reſurrection. For
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:119039:144"/> next to deliverance from the death of the ſoul, which conſiſts in the ſenſe of a remorſe and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſtreſs, what can be more ſweet then the deliverance from the death of the body, which is to have no more ſenſe, nor motion, nor life, nor being? And from the doctrine of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (however profane men gainſay it) reſults an admiration of the Wiſdom of God, in reuniting things which nature had ſo ſtraitly conjoin'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For ſince death (as we have ſhewn) is not a natural thing but an accident ſuperven'd contrary to the purpoſe of nature, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the firſt formation of man, who in regard of the excellence of his ſoul ought to be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal creature, though in reference to his body he was compoſed of the matter of the Elements; what is there more ſutable to Divine Wiſdom, then to reunite without injury either to his juſtice or his goodneſs, what death had ſeparated by a kind of violence? For, to repeat thoſe words of of <hi>Phocylides,</hi> it is not meet to diſſolve the fair harmony of man. And laſtly, though the power of God may be well underſtood other ways, yet herein is one of the greateſt and moſt admirable teſtimonies of it; to wit, that from the earth, and the Sea, and the entrals of birds and beaſts ſhall be required the bodies of men; and that their aſhes which are diſpers'd and confus'd amongſt the Elements, ſhall be recover'd and recollected with ſo much art that every one ſhall reſume his own body without confuſion or mixture. Whence is it therefore, that this doctrine gives offenſe and ſcandal to ſome? Is it repugnant to the Wiſdom of God? We have prov'd it agreeable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:119039:144"/> And it would argue defect of wiſdom in God, if he knew not to diſtinguiſh in this confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Elements the places from whence to retake one day the reliques of our members. Is it impoſſible to his power? Surely no, if we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the ſame infinite; and it is verily infinite, if it be divine. To conclude, doth it encounter rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? There is none of us but would naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the reſurrection of his body, if he eſteemed it a thing poſſible. Wherefore ſeeing God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals to us both that he will and can do it, what is to be doubted more, but that reaſon conſents in this deſire with nature.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> What underſtanding can be had of true Virtue without a particular Revelation,</head>
               <p>HItherto we have ſhewn that in the things which relate directly to God and his ſervice, and the motives of true and ſincere piety, men have either been without a particular revelation, or abſolutely blind, or ſo unreſolv'd and waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what they knew thereof, that they could not from thence render any true devotion to God, nor receive any ſolid conſolation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Our next task ſhould be to ſhew that they likewiſe needed a particular revelation for the knowledge of true Virtue, which ought to be followed amongſt men: but my deſign will not permit me to deduce that point at length; onely I am to deſire the Reader to take notice of two things. Indeed I will not queſtion but that they have had far more knowledge of true vertue by the light of nature alone, then they had of the requiſites and concernments of true piety. The excellent inſtructions of Philoſophers, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Laws of Republicks, virtuous deeds of great perſonages, and the univerſal conſent of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions any thing civilis'd, ſhew by the account they made of Virtue and its excellence, that they were clearer ſighted therein then in other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. Yea there have been found men amongſt them, who being conſidered onely on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and by their actions of valour, juſtice, hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:119039:145"/> moderation, reverence towards parents and love to their country, might ſeem in a manner worthy to be parallel'd with thoſe that have been illuminated by a clearer light of truth; I mean comparatively, as to things of that nature. And the reaſon of this is not difficult to be rendred. For beſides that the knowledge of the duties of men one towards another is ſomewhat more proportionate to their underſtanding, then of thoſe which regard the Deity (whence it is, that <hi>Cicero</hi> is much more certain and poſitive in the deſcription of our mutual obligations in his Books <hi>de Officiis,</hi> then he is in the doctrine of the Nature of the Gods) there ha's been herein an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the divine Providence. For God having purpoſed that the world ſhould ſubſiſt till a certain time which he ha's prefixed to exerciſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that amongſt all ſorts of Nations the ſeed of them ſhould be preſerved whom he would elect for his people, for which cauſe he yet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the earth in its ſecundity; ha's preſided in an eſpecial manner over the minds of Legiſlators and Philoſophers, to guide them to teach things ſutable for the conſervation of humane ſociety, and over the minds of the people in general to cauſe them to comprehend and conform to the ſame. For if men had been as ignorant of right and honeſty, as of God and what directly relates to him, inſtead of aſſemblies of men, Cities and Commonwealths, there would not have been ſeen in the world but troops of ſavage beaſts and great parties of robbers; whence all had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into an horrible chaos. Nevertheleſs as well in this as in other things the particular revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:119039:146"/> of the will of God, would have been not onely profitable for the better civiliſing of them, but alſo of abſolute neceſſity in order to giving them a ſaving knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>For in the firſt place, ſince God is the author and Lord of all the world, and its ſoveraign Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator and governour, was not man made to glorifie him and to direct all his actions and cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to that end? And as his ſupreme good lyes in his communion &amp; conjunction with God, ought not alſo his glory be his higheſt aim? And notwithſtanding, where is there any amongſt the Pagans, even of thoſe who were the greateſt admirers of Virtue, that propoſed as the end of his actions the glory of the Creator of the World? that ſo much as thought that was the end to which they ought to tend? Some have aimed at their own glory, and to gain a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among their fellow-Citizens, and to draw them to admire their Virtues, in ſtead of aſcribing them to God. Others have made Virtute ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to avarice and pleaſure (as <hi>Epicurus</hi>) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her lovely onely in that regard. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though extreme few, held virtue in eſteem indeed becauſe of its natural dignity; but virtue being as it were the image and reſplendency of God, it was not half reflected by being eſteemed, ſince it was not thereby referr'd to the honor of its model, and the ſource from whence it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd into the world. Further, what miſerable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luers were they of its dignity? The greateſt part condemned onely Vices that appear in exterior actions: as if virtue ought not to be aswel the rule of purpoſes and intentions, as of the works of the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:119039:146"/> hand or corporeal deportment; or as if external actions were not good or had onely ſo far as they repreſent the internal diſpoſition of the heart, and take their tincture from it. But if ſome have not onely regulated the actions of men by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but alſo their wills and counſels; yet all have generally err'd in this point, that they have not retrenched the corruption of vice near enough to the quick, but have excuſed the firſt motions that ſwerve from reaſon, as not being in our own power; and could not underſtand that there ought to be in man ſuch a harmony of all his faculties amongſt themſelves, that not the leaſt rebellion might ariſe in his appetites againſt right reaſon. Of which too if ſome have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; it ha's been one of a thouſand, and as it were by chance. Beſides, how ſhameful are the enormities which the greateſt perſonages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them have committed in that which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches moſt clearly? What was in <hi>Plato</hi>'s mind to introduce a community of women into his Republick? who can but bluſh at the reading what <hi>Plutark</hi> hath written concerning love? yea who is not rather aſtoniſhed then aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it? What were the <hi>Lupercalia</hi> of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and the <hi>Bacchanalia</hi> of the Greeks? How laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able was the cuſtome amongſt both thoſe people of lending forth their Wives, if not receiv'd and practis'd commonly, yet at leaſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but authoris'd by the example of <hi>Cato</hi> himſelf? Was it not needful therefore for God to reveal himſelf from heaven, for the reducing marriage to its primitive honeſty, and teaching men by his own voice what they could not learn
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:119039:147"/> from nature, how loud ſoever ſhe ſpeaks therein. And I do not now mean the vulgar people, whoſe virtue was very ſcarce, and onely a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in ſhew, but the moſt eminent, and who by the opinion of their virtue drew the eyes and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of others.</p>
               <p>It is not impertinent here to inſiſt upon what we touched briefly and tranſiently above, to wit, that they knew not what true patience was. For it conſiſts not, as they conceived, in the not feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of evil, no more then a ſtock or ſtone, nor in the yielding to neceſſity becauſe it were to no purpoſe to reſiſt it; but it conſiſts in a moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acquieſcence in the will of God, who diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of all by his Providence; and in bearing ſuch a reverence to his Majeſty, as not onely not to murmur againſt him becauſe it would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit any thing to do ſo, but not to be at all impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, becauſe it is not fitting or lawful. The Creature being bound to obey his Creator even to that point, that if God ſhould purpoſe to acquire glory to himſelf from undeſerved afflictions laid upon it (though he never does ſo) yet the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought not to repine, but rather venerate his wiſdom, ſo as not to inquire why he does it, and to have ſuch an humble ſenſe of it ſelf in compariſon of his Majeſty, that God might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any wrong, even make uſe of its ruin for the illuſtration of his glory. For who does not find this true upon a due perpenſion? who comparing the nothingneſs (as I may ſo ſpeak) of man with the infinite Majeſty of God, can think we ought to complain of him in caſe it ſhould pleaſe him to treat us ſo? Us, I ſay, who uſe ſo
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:119039:147"/> abſolute a right over other animals, who have neither made nor ſupported them, and have none but a borrowed authority to do it. Although there is this proportion between them and us, that we are equally creatures; whereas between God and us there is no commenſurability in any thing whatſoever. Even Kings and Monarks claim ſuch a right over their ſubjects, and very many generous Nations concede the ſame to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſervation.</p>
               <p>But beſides all this there are two moſt excellent virtues taught by divine revelation, which the Pagans were ſo far from ever reckoning ſuch that they accounted the vices contrary to them for laudable virtues. The firſt is Humility, of whoſe recommendation there is no footſtep nor ſhadow to be found in their writings. For it ha's been as an epidemical diſeaſe of their minds, to conſider themſelves in their own plumes &amp; to eſteem not leſs gloriouſly of them and of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then if we were as little Gods upon earth; in which reſpect they ſometimes dar'd (as we have ſeen) to compare, yea to prefer themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gods themſelves. Whereunto the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the true God ha's contributed more then can be imagin'd, and likewiſe the fictions of the Poets concerning all thoſe Romantick Divinities which were adored by the vulgar. And in truth I ſee not why any honeſt woman ought not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her ſelf before <hi>Venus,</hi> according as ſhe is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd to us; ſince Immortality by which alone ſhe ſurpaſs'd humane condition, gave her no other advantage ſaving to practiſe her infamous dulteries to eternity: as <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Phocion</hi> had
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:119039:148"/> grounds to priſe themſelves much above a thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh <hi>Mercury,</hi> or a cruel and bloody <hi>Mars,</hi> whoſe Deity had no other excellence but to be a ſhelter of impunity from their crimes. It was fit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make men know in the firſt place, that though they ſhould have continued in the ſtate of perfection in which they were placed at their firſt creation, yet in compariſon of God they are but inconſiderable worms upon the earth. Next, that they are fallen ſo far below themſelves, that there is no proportion between them and their firſt being; and ſo to teach them to deſpiſe themſelves in compariſon of God, yea to think low of themſelves in compariſon of themſelves; and, which is an infallible ſequel of the little eſteem we make of our ſelves, not to contemn any perſon whatſoever; but to prevent and go beyond all the world in reſpect, and to reverence all ſuch in whom God hath put any mark of his eminence, whether in rare qualities of the mind, or in authority and power.</p>
               <p>The other Virtue conſiſts in the obedience which we render to Kings and Magiſtrates and all ſuperior Powers. For becauſe the Pagans did not perceive any particular Providence of God in the eſtabliſhment of politique or civil order in the world, but thought that it was an inſtitution either purely humane, every people having transfer'd into the hands of one or more of their fellow-Citizens the adminiſtration of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon laws, and the avengement of their violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or at moſt but natural; in as much as thoſe to whom nature had been more bountiful in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:119039:148"/> of underſtanding or prudence, to conduct others, undertook the management of Republicks as the beſt experienced pilots take upon them the ſteering of the ſhip; whence they made no ſcruple where they conceiv'd the perſons entruſted with power abuſed the ſame, or that the caſe were ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and prepoſterous in nature, the leſs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy poſſeſſing themſelves of the government, to rebel againſt their authority, and even to lay violent hands upon thoſe whom they called ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and unjuſt invaders of the liberty of the people. And there is ſcarce any thing found more ordinary among their writings then Elogiums of Aſſaſſins that had ſlain Tyrants, nothing more honored in the publick places of their Cities then their Statues, nothing that they proclaim ſo loud as the defenſe of their liberty, nor any thing that ha's been more advantageouſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned then the killing of the Tyrants of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and the murder of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> for the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome.</hi> But di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation ha's carried our knowledges much higher, and corrected the deficiency of their ſentiments who were not guided by its light. It hath taught us firſt, that there ought to be two kinds of ſocieties in the world; The one Religious, which reſpects the ſervice of God; The other onely Civil, in reference to the affairs of this life; and that God hath ſo diſpenſed things that he ha's impower'd each with its authority, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd over each its governors and rulers. So that as the Civil Power hath nothing to do to ſuperintend in the Religious Society, to give laws to the conſciences of men; but ought to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:119039:149"/> ſubmit it ſelf to thoſe which God hath eſtabliſh'd therein: So the Spiritual Power hath no right to partake with the Secular, which is ordained for the conduct of the world; but ought likewiſe to be ſubject thereunto, without pretending to any prerogative over Kings and Magiſtrates. Moreover, it hath taught us, that although it be not forbidden to people truely free, that is, which have no ſoverain power above them, but have themſelves the authority of their affairs in their hands, to defend their liberty againſt ſuch as would oppreſs it; yet when once they have been ſubjected, and themſelves own'd thoſe that ſubdued them for their ſoverains, they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to render faithful obedience to them. And in reference to the other Society, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Religion, when once it hath gain'd ſome reaſonable form in a place, and order is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd therein, it is the duty of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to obey willingly the conſtitutions which are made therein by thoſe who have the power ſo to do. So that neither the one of theſe Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may attempt any thing againſt the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their rights are ſeparate, and their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration diſtinct; nor any one whatſoever in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them diſturb the publick order by rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, becauſe every man in his ſtation is oblig'd to own it for ſuperior to which he owes obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And this obligation ought to be eſteemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, not onely in reference to conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of order thereby in either of theſe two Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of which every good man ſhould be deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but moreover becauſe they have God for their Author, and therefore they ought to be
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:119039:149"/> honoured with reverence, by reaſon of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of him from whom they derive their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal. So that as piety towards God is as it were the Pillar of the Religious Society, and Juſtice of the Civil, ſo there are onely theſe two caſes in which it is lawful for particular perſons to diſobey theſe two Powers: Firſt, when in the Religious Society ſomething is commanded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to piety: for at ſuch times as the ſuperior abuſes his authority directly againſt God, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes upon the conſcience impious, idolatrous and ſuperſtitious laws, the inviolable command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God ought without contradiction to overweigh the decrees of men. Secondly, when Magiſtrates ordain ſomething contrary to Juſtice and Virtue; for in ſuch caſes uſing their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty directly contrary to the end for which it was given them (to wit, to induce men to things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and commendable, and to contain them in the obſervation of the ſame) none are bound to yield obedience to them. Thus in the One the will of God is the rule, and in the Other that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and equity which nature it ſelf teacheth. In other things, wherein piety do's not ſuffer, nor honeſty and the natural right of things is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated, there is nothing ſo well-pleaſing to God as a ready and willing ſubjection, though it were even painful and laborious: So far is God from permitting attempts againſt the one or the other, of thoſe whom he ha's conſtituted in the government, either to diminiſh their authority or deprive them of Life. In effect, though <hi>Brutus</hi> and his companions thought they had done an heroick action in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinate
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:119039:150"/> of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſar,</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> extoll'd it as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if it had been commanded by ſome Oracle of God himſelf; yet it is certain that it was an evil and culpable attempt, with which their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories will for ever be ſtained. I ſhall not here ſpeak of the ingratitude of which they that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted it may be juſtly impeached, there being none of them but had received ſome remarkable benefit from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or had their lives preſerved by him. Nor ſhall I inſiſt upon the ſucceſs that came of it, that inſtead of freeing the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were the cauſe that they fell under the hands of three or four maſters more rigorous then <hi>Caeſar</hi> was, and who raign'd after a more abſolute and bloody manner. I ſhall alſo omit to preſs what was ſo carefully obſerved by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, that there was not one of the Murderers of that Prince but periſh'd by a violent death, and ſome by their own hands, and with the ſame ſword wherewith they had ſlain him: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the vengeance of God be manifeſt enough therein. I ſhall onely ſay, that when <hi>Caeſar</hi> was after his victory created perpetual Dictator, the people themſelves all together had no power in them to take his authority from him; much leſs had fourteen or fifteen particular perſons any juſt cauſe to conſpire againſt his life. For the perpetual Dictatorſhip being a Soverain Dignity and independant on any other but God, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome</hi> had indeed a power to confer the ſame, by voluntarily ſurrendring up their liberty to him; but after they had conferr'd it, it was not in their power to revoke or annull it, ſo long as the perſon they had inveſted with it was
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:119039:150"/> living. Wherefore it ought not to be doubted but that the death of <hi>Caeſar</hi> was a horrible parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide.</p>
               <p>Hereunto ought to be conjoyned the precept we have not to exerciſe our own revenge our ſelves. For ſince Revenge, if good and lawful, is an adminiſtration of juſtice, and not a ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our paſſions; there being none but God that adminiſters juſtice in the World, as being the ſole governor of it, either immediately and by himſelf, or by the intervention of Magiſtrates (whom he hath appointed guardians of Laws and conſervators of humane Society) he that receives an injury, ought not to do himſelf reaſon for it, in as much as thereby he would indulge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent his own paſſion, and not execute a juſt and lawful vengeance; but it is fit that reparation be done him for it by their means to whom the care of right and preſervation of laws is committed. And if theſe fail him, he muſt attend that God himſelf do it for him, having a perſwaſion that he is the preſerver of the rights of all, and that when men ſail in their duty he does not forget to correct their faults.</p>
               <p>For a man to attempt ſatisfaction of his wrong himſelf, would be to invade the government of God; and to ſlight or implead the Magiſtrates, would be an expreſs overturning of things eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by God himſelf. To him it belongs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the injuries of private, and the injuſtices committed by publick perſons. Nevertheleſs it is evident that if they have little underſtood the moderation which ought to be held in point of revenge, and the means of purſuing ſatisfaction
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:119039:151"/> of an injury; they have been yet more ignorant of that precept which Wiſdom it ſelf gives us (and right reaſon too, if we would hearken to it) Of loving our very enemies, and procuring good to thoſe that offend us. And yet if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of Mans nature conſiſts in reſemblance with God; ſince God is ſo good and ſo patient towards the Wicked, and notwithſtanding their offenſes, their crimes and blaſphemies, awaits their amendment with ſo great indulgence, and invites them thereunto with perpetual clemency and goodneſs, how can man ever attain his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, if he do not imitate God in this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Moreover ſince the publick good is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple to be preferr'd before that of any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon, and that if there be any good in the hatred which we bear to our enemies, it lies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome particular contentment, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by following the motions of our nature (if the pleaſure of letting looſe the bridle to one's paſſions may be called good, which ought rather to be reſtrained by right reaſon) and ſince on the contrary the good of the Commonwealth and humane ſociety receives advancement by the virtue and proſperity of our enemies; how much more prevalent reaſon is there to love then to hate them, that is, to deſire that they may become good and happy for themſelves and ornaments of the Commonwealth in general, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to wiſh their ſhame and calamity for the gratifying a particular paſſion? Laſtly, ſince Hatred is a deſire of ſeeing evil befal the perſon we hate, and no man ought to undergo evil but he that deſerves the ſame by his wickedneſs;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:119039:151"/> how can we be virtuous our ſelves, if we deſire that others ſhould become vicious; ſeeing a good man ſhould wiſh that if poſſible all the world might become like himſelf, and virtue is a good that naturally deſires to be communicated and expanded? Or how can we deſire that they were virtuous and yet calamitous together? Nevertheleſs the Philoſophers have ſcarce ſeen ſo much as a ſhadow of this doctrine? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conclude in brief, that even in the knowledge of true virtue as well as in what concerns the nature of God and his legitimate ſervice, humane reaſon is ſo defective, that without the aid of a ſupernatural light, it can neither conſtitute nor practiſe any thing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and of worth.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> What the principal tokens and evidences are by which this particular Revelation may be known and diſtinguiſh'd.</head>
               <p>BUt admitting (will ſome ſay) That the reaſons above alledged induce to confeſs that a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and celeſtial revelation is either highly important, or abſolutely neceſſary; yet where ſhall we find it? For all ſorts of Nations have boaſted of the ſame; and the mind of man is ſo incertain in its judgments, that in this variety and confuſion of voices, wherewith every one pretends to it, it is difficult if not impoſſible to be reſolved. We are ſufficiently ſenſible of our need, but we are at a loſs in finding wherewith to ſatisfie it; and in caſe we ſhould have found it, yet we can ſcarce be aſſured that that were the true remedy of our evil. For as ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may ſwallow poiſon while he conceives he uſes a good medicament, ſo another when he uſes a ſafe remedy, may yet think that he takes ſome noxious poiſon. To this difficulty we muſt give an anſwer before we paſs further to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of their opinion, who acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eſpecial declaration of the will of God in reference to his ſervice, do nevertheleſs eſteem the external profeſſions of all Religions indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:119039:152"/>
               <p>It is moſt certain that if it were ſo, that ſome perſon had the true revelation of the will of God in all theſe things and in the declaration of all theſe truths, and yet did not believe that it was proceeded from God, it would be in no wiſe profitable unto him. No, not if he were but in ſuſpence concerning it. For it is not with this as it is with drugs. A good medicine may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a man of diſtemper'd fancy, which will not fail to do him good, though he believe it an invenom'd potion. Becauſe the Phyſick needs not the intervention of opinion or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to produce its effect, but directly acts upon the humors of the body and the parts affected. But here the medicine is taken and digeſted onely in the mind, and works not but by the mediation of belief, and that a certain, clear, and ſetled one, which excites the paſſions and affections; for this is the property of all perſwaſions that are impreſſed of a thing that muſt be reduc'd to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, ſuch as the doctrine of piety and virtue is. But if on the other ſide, we receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with a firm belief that doctrine of truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven, it is abſolutely impoſſible for it not to diſplay its power, and make us feel its efficacy. So that all the difficulty lies in being perſwaded, and finding certain tokens or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences which may make it be indubitably own'd. All Nations indeed boaſt of having it; neither ought it ſeem ſtrange that they do ſo. For though the Underſtanding be to the ſoul as the Eye is to the Body; yet there is this difference in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, that when a man is born blind, though by the many ſlips and ſtumbles that befall him at
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:119039:153"/> every ſtep, he obſerves well that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neceſſary for his guidance wanting to him, yet cannot one impoſe ſo far upon him, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous ſo ever he be of ſight, as to make him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he does really ſee: His own ſentiment &amp; experience invalidating the credit of thoſe that ſhould go about to abuſe him with ſuch an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. And if there wasever found a blind perſon that imagin'd that he ſaw, he had not onely darkneſs in the eyes of his body, but alſo diſtemper and diſorder in his mind. In the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the caſe is not the ſame; Becauſe it is not become extinguiſh'd by ſin in us, but we diſcourſe and reaſon upon the appearances of things, and indeavor to diſcern the true from the falſe; and there being many things abſolutely falſe, which are partly colour'd with falſe ſhews, and partly find a faculty in us eaſily to be deceiv'd; hence, I ſay, it happens to us, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the falſe for the true, we nevertheleſs imagine we have embraced the pure verity it ſelf. And there are principally two things which here render us lyable to impoſture: The firſt is, that not being able of our ſelves to invent or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the truth in the point of the knowledge of God and of his ſervice, and having not in our corrupted and obſcured minds any certain rules to examine what is propos'd to us concerning the ſame, all that ſeems to ſurpaſs our capacity, and ha's any thing of ſtrange and extraordinary, if it be preſented to us as divine, is readily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and our ignorance conciliates authority and reverence to it; as <hi>Lucretius</hi> ſaies,
<q>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:119039:153"/>
                     <l>Omnia enim ſtolidi magis admirantur amantque</l>
                     <l>Inverſis quia ſub verbis latitantia cernunt.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>As a man that ſhould have never ſeen true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amonds, but onely heard ſome body perhaps as ignorant in Jewels as himſelf, ſpeak of them, might be eaſily gull'd by the firſt counterfeits that were preſented to him, and would take that to be brought from the bottom of the <hi>Indian</hi> Seas which was but gather'd from the rocks of his own country. The ſecond thing is the ſenſe of our neceſſity, which cauſes that as famiſh'd peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple eat and make good cheer with Garlick and Huſkes, ſo men receive all ſorts of Religions as divine, by reaſon of the ſenſe that the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath of its natural want, though they ſcarce ought to be counted amongſt Sciences purely humane. Which though it be ſo, yet the truth of God is but one, uniform, and like to it ſelf, and is not found but in one certain place. For would God who is one and immutable, reveal the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſerving him in one place, after one faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and after another in another? It is not in this caſe, as it is with Princes who have divers Kingdomes, whereby it is perhaps neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them to comply with the cuſtomes of Nations, their laws and languages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would be incommodious and difficult to rank them under the ſame conſtitutions, every people having their peculiar inclinations, and every climat its manners of acting, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be alter'd without danger of invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all in great diſorder. And though the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:119039:154"/> maximes of Policy, and the foundations it ha's in the natural juſtice and honeſty of things be ever immutable and uniform, yet this do's not hinder but that ſeveral Commonwealths may be conſtituted after different formes, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular laws upon which they are founded be accommodated and varied ſometimes in one caſe and ſometimes in another according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of circumſtances. But the nature of God being always like to it ſelf in all Ages, and the nature of man always one in all Nations, there muſt be always one and the ſame ſervice to God, and to men one and the ſame rule of piety and virtue. If there be a difference found therein at any time, it is (as we ſhall ſee God willing in due place) in things which are not eſſential to Religion, but in ſome external ſhew of things of a midde quality and indifferent in themſelves. So that either God ha's declared this his will but to one Nation alone, or if he ha's declared it to more, it ha's been by an equal and uniform revelation. And whereas Religions are extremely confus'd, this muſt have ſome tokens to diſtinguiſh it from all others, whereby it may be infallibly known: which are now the buſineſs of our enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Without queſtion the beſt knowledge that can be had of the nature of a medicament is from the good, ready and certain relief received by it in a diſeaſe; After which experience there is no need of ſearching further into its qualities, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to gather occaſions of admiring it more. In like manner, the beſt knowledge that can be had of the revelation of heavenly truth in this point,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:119039:154"/> is by proof of the comfort that it affords to the ſouls of men, and by its efficacy of cleanſing them from the corruption of ſin; of which if we do not complain, we are more then ſtupid and inſenſible. But on the one ſide they that know the truth by this evidence, ſcarce require any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and on the other ſide we have now to do with them that cannot know this truth by the experience of its virtue, till they have firſt had ſome taſt of it by an other way. Wherefore it is neceſſary for us to ſpeak of it in another ſort, and to ſhew briefly, that provided a man brings the like docility to attain it that he does to the ſtudy of humane Sciences, that is to ſay, a mind clear of all prejudice, affected to truth, and free from importunate and contentious quarrelling, the ſearch is not laborious, nor the attainment difficult; ſo far are the pains imploy'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in likely to be unprofitable.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I conceive, there is none will deny but that if there be a Religion in which all the truths we have above conſidered, are found, either wholly revealed, or illuſtrated ſufficiently to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the irreſolution of the mind of man, and to fix his agitations, by contenting the inſatiable deſire of knowledge which is in us, that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is divine. For ſince there never was not onely any Nation, but not ſo much as one ſingle perſon in any Nation that comprehended all theſe truths together; What God is in his own nature, How he hath created the World, In what manner he governs it, What is the cauſe and origine of Death, Whence all the diſorder we behold in man and in the world came to paſs,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:119039:155"/> where we are to ſeek the knowledge of the means to obtain remiſſion of our ſins, What hope there is of the Reſurrection of the body, yea What certainty there is of the doctrine of the immortality of our ſouls; nor any of them ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſtinctly: do's it not follow that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which ha's ſo clear'd up all theſe truths, that for the future there remains nothing to be doubted concerning them, or known, for the ſatisfaction of our minds therewith, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily proceede from ſome other then the mind of man? For there is no more to be expected af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tryal of the utmoſt power of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the diſcovery of theſe points. New Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries have in our times been found in the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> which were unknown to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. But the Sea and the Wind carried the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverers thither; there needed but a little more daring, to ſail forth from the coaſts of one's country into the main Sea, and a ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter obſervation of the Needle and the Stars to direct the courſe: and the arrival upon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of thoſe regions was an indubitable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of their exiſtence. But ſhould the World be turned about from Eaſt to Weſt, and from North to South, there would be ſeen but one and the ſame Sun and the ſame Heavens, Lands, Seas, Rivers and Men, and the ſame order in the nature of things, which the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers contemplated in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Druyds</hi> in <hi>Gallia,</hi> the <hi>Brachmans</hi> and <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> the <hi>Magi</hi> and Aſtrologers in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and Prieſts and myſterious divines in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Scythians</hi> had their Sages who addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:119039:155"/> to the ſearch of things humane and divine. Therefore there muſt either ſpring up an other new kind of men, or it muſt not be hoped that any ſhould ſee clear in this wherein all others have been blind. Now if this revelation be not proceeded from the mind of man, it muſt be come from God; no other could have given it us. For Demons cannot here reaſonably be brought into the Scene. If they be, I demand whether they were good or bad. If good, they did it by the inſtinct and command of God; and ſo we have what we drive at. If bad, how could they which are the authors and lovers of lying teach us truths which oppoſe and condemn them, and ruine the dominion which they bear over the minds of men by means of ignorance? And ſince all ſuch truth tends to the glory of God, and the wellfare of mankind, theſe eſpecially, how could wicked Demons be induc'd to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the knowledg of them to men, being equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemies to Heaven and Earth? And in as much as every Religion profeſſes either to teach things or to contain myſteries ſurpaſſing the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humane underſtanding (for there never was any but pretended to deep ſecrets not to be ſounded by the Reaſon of man, that ſo it might be more venerable) if there be ſound one in which there are certain doctrines raiſed above our reach, ſo interwoven with truths which we comprehend, and whereof it ha's given us an abſolute certainty, that they illuſtrate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm one another; ſo that what we underſtand aſſures us of the truth of that which we do not fully comprehend, and what we do not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:119039:156"/> comprehend connects truths together already underſtood, as a neceſſary cement to hinder the diſſipation of the whole work: who can doubt but that it is God that connected thoſe truths to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by an indiſſoluble concatenation? For without doubt they are truths, though we do not comprehend them; ſeeing they ſupport others, of whoſe evidence reaſon is convinc'd, which would otherwiſe be ungrounded and infirm; their verity, I ſay, appears from this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and it muſt needs be ſome other then the mind of man that ha's imploy'd them to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſince that is not capable to comprehend their nature.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, whereas it was well ſaid by One, That things of greateſt antiquity are beſt, and the Philoſophers themſelves, when they treat concerning God and Religion, extremely cry up Antiquity, and attribute much to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of their Anceſtors; as if nature it ſelf had ſuggeſted to them, that there was a ſource of all theſe things, from which they that were neareſt it drew the pureſt and ſincereſt waters, whereas accordingly as they are derived through ſeveral minds as ſo many ſeveral conduit-pipes, they become corrupted and tincted with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous qualities and contract impurity; If there be found a doctrine that ha's all the marks of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and there appears nothing in the world that equals it, it ought not to be doubted but that the ſame is proceeded from him that is more ancient then all, as being author of all things. If the language in which it was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be as the mother and ſtock from which others,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:119039:156"/> though very ancient, are ſprung; if it deſcribes the hiſtory of the world and of men, and their propagation upon the earth; if it affords the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of times, and that without it the knowledge of Chronology would be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate then a Labyrinth; if it deduces its hiſtory from point to point with an exact correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if it clearly and certainly relates hiſtories that are as the body of the fabulous ſhadows that we ſee in the writings of the moſt ancient authors in the World, who will doubt but all which they have is taken from thence, and that we ought to refer what is therein deprav'd and corrupted thereunto as to its principle, and have recourſe thither to learn what we are ignorant of?</p>
               <p>Moreover, as the minds of men are ſo various, that we ſcarce ſee a ſon follow the deſign of his fathers building, when the foundations of it are laid, and the walls already erected; much leſs do they willingly conform throughout to their predeceſſors in Sciences and diſciplines, every one being ambitious of the glory of having aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, corrected or invented ſome thing (which occaſion'd ſo many ſects of Philoſophers and Lawyers) If there be found a Religion, all whoſe parts accord together with an excellent harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (although it ha's been propounded at ſeveral times and by ſeveral perſons in ſeveral places) and are ſo far from difformity, that they conſiſt &amp; unite together with a perfect proportion, though ſeveral workmen have labor'd therein; can it be denyed but that it was one and the ſame Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect that always preſided over the work, ſeeing it
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:119039:157"/> is manag'd with ſo equal and uniform a conduct? Whereas even the Palaces of Kings are compoſed of parts oftimes ſo diſagreeing that they diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage the edifice, according as ſucceſſors have had different fancies from their anceſtors: yea even ſuch as have been built by one alone, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways repreſent ſomething in their contrivance which argues the inconſtance and imbecillity of man. But eſpecially if there be found a Doctrine, whoſe revelations or ſupernatural truths having been very little and obſcure at the beginning, ſo that it was impoſſible for the mind of man to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain them, have yet many hundred years after been multiplyed in ſo ſutable a manner, that it is dubious which to admire moſt, either the conſentaneouſneſs between the principles and their ſequels, or the faculty that was requiſite to deduce the ſame from them and to unfold them after a manner perfectly admirable; There is no queſtion but he was the ſame that caſt the ſeed into the earth and made it grow, that firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thoſe invelop'd ſparkles of light and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards illuſtrated and unveiled them. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, inaſmuch as God is the author of all things, his glory ought to be their natural end; but as none of the moſt knowing Philoſophers ever propos'd the ſame to himſelf, or indevour'd to ſhew the tendency of things thereunto, yea on the contrary the moſt part ſpeak nor of God, or if they do 'tis with ſome notorious diſadvantage to his glory; If there be a Doctrine that aims wholly and all whoſe parts conſpire unanimouſly thereunto, muſt it not be ſaid that God intended the ſame as a means to redreſs the diſtraction and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:119039:157"/> wandering of humane minds, and to reduce them into the right way? For how could it be that men ſhould ſo prodigiouſly neglect the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, unleſs they were eſtrayed from their end, ſince they were made for it? And how were they able, when once loſt in a ſtrange Country, ſo well to recover the direct path again of themſelves? Every Religion ought to contain the teſtimonies of Gods good will to mankind, and the duties of men towards him. If therefore, there be a diſcipline, a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, a book, a ſociety in which God himſelf ſpeaks to men in a ſtyle and manner agreeable to the eminence of his Majeſty, diſplays his juſtice to them moſt terrible in its appearance, diſcovers his power in its higheſt magnificence, and gives them to ſound the bredth and length, depth and heigth of his infinite mercies, after a manner which cannot but raviſh the thought of man with admiration, who can imagine that ever any man durſt ſpeak ſo? And laſtly if examples of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable virtue be found therein, with inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and inſtructions to piety, ſuch as are not to be parallell'd any other where in the world, 'tis an indubitable argument that they are proceded from ſome other then the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane mind or the School of man.</p>
               <p>It is natural to men to aſpire after a ſupreme good; it is inſeparably rooted and fixed in our minds. Yet never any man attain'd it, or could ſo much as certainly tell wherein it conſiſts: and 'tis lamentable to obſerve how different, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and incongruous the opinions of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have been in a matter of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:119039:158"/> Therefore if there be any Doctrine that diſcovers the variety and ſolly of thoſe that ſo groſly deceived themſelves about it, and which brings to light and expoſes to the eyes of all the earth a Beatitude that comprehends all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies the Philoſophers were able to expreſs in this point, and infinitely more, who can doubt but that it was God himſelf that hath ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this torch to diſſipate all the darkneſſes of our minds? Laſtly, Man being fallen from ſo high a degree of perfection into ſo great a corruption, of which Heaven and Earth and his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence bears him witneſs, and there being by that means ſo large an abyſſe between God and him, a war ſo irreconcilable between his juſtice and our offenſes; If there be a Doctrine that teaches an expedient to fill up this gulf, and, as I may ſo ſpeak, to build a bridge over it, to renew the commerce and correſpondence between God and us, procuring ſatisfaction to his juſtice, and raiſing us up from our ruines, is it not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſequent that it was God himſelf that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd it? For what edifice ever erected it ſelf when it was fallen, and emerg'd anew out of its rubbidge? To him that is fallen from the favour of God into his indignation, who can ſhew the hope and means of his reconciliation but God himſelf? And I ſhall not fear confidently to aſſert that ſuch a Religion ought beſides the preceding evidences be authoriſed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, maintained againſt its enemies, and be effectuall to be perſwaded after an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:119039:158"/> manner. Wherefore if there be one to which God hath born witneſs by great and ſignal miracles, which ſurpaſs both the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of humane nature and the illuſions of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, and even the faculties of any malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſpirit and the higheſt intelligences, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they could not be performed but by the power of God, and that it profeſſes to be proceeded from him, who can be ſo bold as to gain-ſay it? For without diſpute God could never have afforded his power to the confirmation of a lye, or revealed himſelf from Heaven expreſſely in ſuch miraculous works to favour an impoſture, that pretends to his name with a falſe title. Moreover, if being converſant in the world as a ſtranger, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by all Nations, ardently perſecuted by malignant ſpirits, and by ſuch as they had ſeduced by their illuſions, and drawn to their ſervice, it ha's been as it were viſibly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by dreadful judgements diſcharged both upon the perſons and Nations that oppoſed it, by peſtilence and mortalities, by famines and wars, by ſubverſions of Cities and diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Kingdomes; it muſt needs be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly loved by the Deity, ſince he ſo terribly revenges the injuries that are done to it. Laſtly, being wholly deſigned for reclaiming men off from Idolatry and ſuperſtition to the ſervice of the true God, and conforming their irregular appetities to reaſon; a thing impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be done, becauſe men naturally love Idols as debauched men do courtiſans, and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:119039:159"/> are yet addicted to their own concupiſcences as much or more then they are to idols: nevertheleſs if it ha's ſurmounted all reſiſtance, overcome the moſt obſtinate hearts, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed gloriouſly over the humane underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, leading their thoughts as priſoners by the force and clearneſs of its truth, ſo that it ha's ſubjugated even the greateſt Empires, and all other Religions, doctrines, and ſects have fallen and been ſcatter'd before it; Who can doubt for the future but that it is a divine truth and accompanied with divine aſſiſtance? Eſpecially ſince for the propagating of it into all quarters of the world there was employed neither arms nor factions and conſpiracies, nor the favour of great men, nor commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of people nor the ſubtlety of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, nor the eloquence of Orators, nor any thing elſe that bears a ſplendor and luſtre in the eyes of men, but onely the naked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall of a ſimple truth, and a firm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible reſolution to indure all things for it. Certainly, where the means which men ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſerve themſelves of are rejected, and ſuch as are contrary to them uſed, the deſign cannot but be ſome other then humane. And if it proſper in ſpight of the world's and mens oppoſition it muſt needs be through a divine and celeſtial virtue. Now we ſhall ſee (by the help of God's grace) in the ſequell that there is a Religion in the world to which all theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens or evidences do ſute and agree, and that they cannot be found but in that alone:
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:119039:159"/> and this in order to evince (as my firſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe obliges me) that they who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a particular or ſpecial revelation from Heaven in matter of Religion ought not to account all kinds indifferent as to external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: which muſt be the ſubject of the third part of my Work.</p>

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:119039:161"/> declared the moſt evident tokens by which the ſame may be known, it ſhould be our next buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to enquire where they are found, in as much as Religion will infallibly be there found alſo. And this ought without longer diſpute to be ſufficient againſt thoſe, who acknowledging the neceſſity of this particular revelation, &amp; likewiſe confeſſing that there is ſuch in the world, do not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding account the external profeſſion of all Religions indifferent. For where God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his truth, and declared his will in things that concern him and his ſervice, what humane imaginations are to be preferr'd before him, or what excuſes can be pleaded for diſobedience unto him? But the obſtinacy of men, and the importance of the matter requires further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing and illuſtration.</p>
               <p>In man there are three diſtinct faculties, of which each ha's its reſpective influence in the profeſſion and exerciſe of Religion: The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, wherewith we apprehend the truth of things: The Will, in which are the motions of piety and habits of virtue: And the Senſes, which are ſubſervient to both. For it is by the Senſes that objects arrive to the Underſtanding, and by the Underſtanding they excite ſutable motions in the Will. Upon which account there muſt be three ſorts of things in Religion that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond thereunto. Firſt, ſuch as are propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as truths to be believ'd, that ſo man, who is otherwiſe buried in ignorance, may attain a wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom worthy the excellence of his nature. For how can Religion ſubſiſt without a true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the nature of God and his Attributes, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:119039:161"/> other truths dependent thereon, ſo far at leaſt as humane underſtanding is capable of the ſame? And ſince the ſupreme perfection of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the legitimate practiſe of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how can man be render'd perfect, if his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect remain notwithſtanding clouded with darkneſs and ignorant of the moſt excellent of all natures, and from which alone all other things derive their perfection? The ſecond ſort of things include ſuch as are propoſed not onely to be believed but to be done, and which lye in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; as the precepts of piety towards God and charity amongſt men, the duties of which are diffus'd through all the parts of humane life. Laſtly, the third comprehends all external things, as the actions and ceremonies deſigned to give inſtruction of that which muſt be believ'd, and to beget affection towards that which is to be done, with that regularity according to which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Society is adminiſtred. Now all theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars ought to have ſuch an accord among them, that the truths propoſed to be believ'd be of a nature proper to beget piety and virtue in the minds of men; n as much as there is ſo ſtrait an alliance between the Underſtanding and the Will, that the Will follows the ſteerage &amp; government of reaſon, which is the guide and conductor of it: Whence that the motions of piety may be ſincere, and worthy of the perſon in whom they are and to whom they are directed, it is requiſite that the wiſdom of the underſtanding be very pure, and its light very ſerene &amp; clear. In like maner it is requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that the precepts which contain the duties of piety and virtue have no repugnance with the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:119039:162"/> truths in knowledge of which conſiſts the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the underſtanding, but as they mutually depend on one another, ſo there may be a perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct correſpondence between them. And laſtly, it is meet that the ceremonies and external govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this ſociety have ſuch a congruity with all other things of Religion that firſt they be in nothing repugnant to the truths in which wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom conſiſts, and next that they be peculiarly inſtrumental to the begetting and exciting of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and virtue. For as the internal part of man is much more excellent then his external, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is deſtinated to perfectionate his ſoul; ſo is it fit that the exterior and ſenſible things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as inſtruments thereunto be proper to the end to which they are adreſſed. And it would be a great abſurdity to imploy means to attain to ſuch an end which were not onely uncongruous therewith but oppoſite and contrary.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus premiſed, I demand whether they that believe a celeſtial revelation neceſſary and think there is one in the world, and nevertheleſs account the external profeſſion of all Religions indifferent, place this indifference in the belief of truths propoſed to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to give credit thereunto more or leſs as ſeems good to us; or whether they place it in the practiſe of that piety and virtue which is principally ſeated in the Will, to perform which of thoſe precepts we pleaſe and no more; or laſtly, whether it be in external communion of thoſe ceremonies, and viſible government by which the Religious Society is adminiſtred, to diſpoſe of the ſame according to our humor, to
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:119039:162"/> omit ſuch as are injoyned by this revelation, and embrace ſuch as are oppoſite to them when we think ſit, retaining in the mean while both the belief of thoſe truths inviolable and the internal practiſe of piety, honeſty, and virtue in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments amongſt men. Certainly, it is not probable that they account the belief of thoſe truths indifferent which are offer'd to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to be believ'd by a divine revelation. For even in things not relating to Religion, and in themſelves of little importance, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of truth is without compariſon better then the belief of falſhood. And I do not conceive there is any perſon ſo brutiſh and unworthy the name of man, as to think it indifferent what ſort of Philoſophy to embrace, in caſe it were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely known in which ſect the truth and certain intelligence of things were to be had. Truth is ſo beautiful and admirable that ſhe raviſhes the minds of men into her love; and the more puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed and ſublime they are the more violent is the love they be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What did not thoſe perſons of old do, whoſe names are ſo ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in the world, to find her out where they believed the diſcovery poſſible? What tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of joy did they reſent when they hapned on any footſtep or trace of her? What vows and wiſhes did they make to find her? And what an expreſſion was that of <hi>Plato,</hi> when he proteſted that if he could have found a man that knew how to Define aright, he would have caſt himſelf at his feet to adore him? And neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the buſineſs was perhaps onely concerning the knowledge of a Goat or Caterpiller. But if
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:119039:163"/> God himſelf had declared in which ſect of Philoſophy the truth were, who would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards have eſteemed the profeſſion thereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different? And who would have had ſo little regard not onely to the dignity of truth, but to the authority of God and to his teſtimony? If, I ſay, he had commanded that the Tenets of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhould be believed rather then thoſe of <hi>Plato,</hi> as being of more truth, who would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be a Platoniſt, with an abſolute contempt of truth, whoſe value is ineſtimable, and the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony that God had given it, the weight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is of ſoveraign authority, and his expreſs commandment whoſe majeſty is inviolable? Now if this be true, in reference to Philoſophy, with which humane life might eaſily diſpence, how much more do's it hold good in Religion, whoſe truths revealed from God are ſo important not onely to the preſent time but to all eternity? Truths, I ſay, to which he hath render'd ſuch teſtimonies? Whereof he hath given ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs commandment, with terrible threatnings againſt incredulity, and abundant and gracious promiſes to thoſe that embrace the ſame with a ſtedfaſt belief? But much leſs will they place their indifference in the practice of internal pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is ſeated in the affections of the heart. For as for piety it ſelf, <hi>Epicurus</hi> durſt not queſtion whether it ought to be exerciſed towards the Deity, or no; how therefore do they that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge both a Providence of God in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, and a particular revelation of his will in matter of his ſervice, preſume to diſpute it, or place it in indifference? And as
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:119039:163"/> for the manner of performing it, if God himſelf ha's declar'd what fiducary recumbence we ought to have on his goodneſs, what reverence of his glorious majeſty, what dread of his juſtice, what gratitude for his benefits, or what ardour and aſſurance in calling upon him in neceſſity, and what obedience to his commandments, who will be ſo bold or ſtupid as to vſe or oppoſe humane imaginations againſt the declaration that it hath pleas'd him to make thereof. 'Tis a thing we would not tolerate in our children or ſervants, to comment upon or diſpute our commandments even in ſmall matters when we have once ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our intentions; much leſs can we endure that they ſlight the ſame to follow their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>It remaines therefore that they place this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the communion of external ceremonies; which yet they have no better grounds for then in the two preceding particulars. For firſt, the communion in external ceremonies in matter of Religion hath always been eſteemed an open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the conſent that is yielded by the heart to things propoſed therein to be believed as truths, and to be practis'd as good and honeſt. And as naturally, in point of conſcience, the mind refuſes to communicate in the ceremonies of a Religion, whoſe maximes are contrary to its ſentiments, and the precepts which refer to manners contrary to what he eſteems juſt and honeſt; ſo it ha's ever been a univerſal ſanction in all ſocieties that have born the name of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, not to admit any to the ceremonies rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it, but onely ſuch as profeſs to receive
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:119039:164"/> both the precepts and doctrines of the ſame. What a ſtrange opinion therefore is this? That it is lawful for a man to abſtain from things to which God hath injoyned teſtimonies to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed of the internal conſent that is yielded to the truths revealed by him and to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he hath given, and contrarily to communicate in ſuch which are the types or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quels of lyes and errors abhorred in the inward ſenſe of the ſoul? It is the cuſtome, when the external profeſſion of a Religion, which conſiſts in the practiſe and communion of its exerciſes, is deſerted, and a different taken up, to renounce ſolemnly ſuch things as were believ'd before, and to proteſt ingagement into new beliefs. Dare they ſay it is lawful for a man to do ſo againſt his conſcience? That is to atteſt both his conſcience and God that ſees it, that he condemns that for a Lye which he believes in his heart to be truth, and to embrace as a truth that which he knows in the ſenſe of his ſoul to be a Lye? If they think thus, I do not diſpute againſt them. For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared from the beginning that I would take my reaſons from the motions of nature and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; which theſe people have quite extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, with all remains of natural generoſity and ingenuity. I refer them to him that will deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revenge perjury, and before whom that plea will do them no ſervice,
<q>Juravi lingua, mentem injuratam gero.</q> But ſuppoſing this were not ſo exactly obſerved, yet the participation alone in the ceremonies of a
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:119039:164"/> Religion is a declaration of approving its max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes. Therefore perhaps they account it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to allow by external profeſſion the doctrines which we condemn in our minds, and on the contrary to condemn by outward behaviour that which we tacitly and inwardly approve. If it be ſo, ſincerity and candor, the qualifications ſo worthy all honeſt perſons, are periſht from the earth. For if this be lawful in that which belongs to the truth of God and things that concern him, why is it not as lawful in the conduct of humane life? It muſt be lawful to wear the liver of an enemy to one's King, to lye at every turn, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray and deceive; and inſtead of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of men free and fair in their converſation we ſhall ſee nothing but viſards and diſguiſes. Moreover, ſince the ceremonies of Religion ought to be of a nature apt to excite piety and virtue in the minds of men, to which the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and precepts of Religion tend, how can it be lawful to abſtain from partaking in thoſe which God ha's appointed for that end, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with ſuch as are remote and averſe from it? Is it not to diſclaim the exerciſe of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and piety it ſelf, and to be addicted to vice and Idolatry or irreligion whereunto the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lead? For the ceremonies of a falſe Religion as well as of the true correſpond with that which is taught for truth, and conſpire to the ſame end. Thoſe which are conjoyn'd with the truth revealed by God aim at ſincere piety, and the perfection of the mind of man. On the contrary, thoſe which accompany falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, lead to the corruption and perverſion of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:119039:165"/> the ſoul: And 'tis like as if a man ſhould purpoſe to ſail from the South with a Northen Wind, or ridde much ground forward by drawing his feet backward. Furthermore, the communion in ceremonies is a part of ſervice performed to God in a Religion; for man as compoſed of body and ſoul, owes homage to God with both. But he can render no religious homage with the body but by participating in ſome ſacred ceremonies. Wherefore if God ha's not approved by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand nor any other manner whatſoever, the ceremonies to which we conform, who ha's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd us that they will be acceptable devotions unto him? And if we abſtain from ſuch as he hath commanded, who gave us this authority of diſpenſing with his commandments and to order the rules of his ſervice at our pleaſure both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him and againſt him? And laſtly, ſince Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a ſociety which ought to be the more ſtrict, ſacred, and inviolable, in as much as it confederates men with God and between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whereas civil governments are contriv'd onely for the ſociety of men together; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tyes that ligue us to God do equally concern the ſoul and the body (the ſoul by the belief of truths and communion of pious and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral precepts, the body by external ceremonies) whereas civil polities binde men onely in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the body and bodily concernments: what reaſon can there be thus to ſeparate the things which God ha's conjoyn'd, and to diſſipate that ſociety which he would have be permanent?</p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:119039:165"/>
               <p>But behold their main reaſon, with which they think themſelves impregnable; namely, That all external things are neither good nor evil of their own nature; and therefore being indetermined in themſelves as to thoſe reſpects, it depends of our intention, and the end to which we deſign them, to give them, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, their ſpecifical being: So that they which make them ſubſervient to Superſtition and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, corrupt them; but ſuch as deſtinate them to another end, uſe them well, and render them good. Now it is the part of the minde to deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them to certain ends, and therefore they ought to be judged of by the thoughts of the heart: As when a thing is equally counterpoiſed on both ſides, it depends on him that manages it, to incline it either this way or the other, and to determine the dubious propendency he obſerves in it. But this is eaſie to be refell'd by any that conſiders well the nature of indifferent things; for there are ſome things, in which whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in themſelves, or as they have reſpect to a certain end, there is nothing that can warrant them the title of good or evil, according to that kinde of goodneſs or badneſs from whence men are denominated vicious or vertuous. I demand therefore, Whether in the revelation which God hath made concerning his ſervice, he hath commanded or prohibited any things of this nature? or whether he hath mentioned none ſuch? If he hath commanded any, then the uſage thereof is not free for the future; his Law ought to be obeyed, not diſputed or diſpenſed with; nor is the exception allowable, that the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:119039:166"/> thing of its own nature obliges neither to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance nor abſtinence; for the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God hath changed its nature, and though it obliges not conſidered in it ſelf, yet it does ſo upon account of his Authority that commanded it: If there be any forbidden, the caſe is the ſame, the doing thereof is no longer indifferent; Indeed the nature of the thing, ſetting aſide the prohibition, allows us liberty to uſe it, but that liberty is annull'd by the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition: And it is an equal ſin not to do the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things which God hath commanded, and to do the indifferent which he hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; namely, the violation of his Command; Otherwiſe there would be left no preheminence to God above man, not ſo much as men claim over one another. But if God hath made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of ſuch things in this Declaration of his will, the exerciſe thereof is partly free, and partly not; It is free, if the ſame be not referr'd to Religion, but ranked amongſt things purely humane: For then every mans prudence is a Law to him to uſe them or not; if he does not truſt his own judgement, the prudence of thoſe whoſe advice he may conſult, ought to ſerve him for a rule in ſuch a caſe; For it is the will of God and Nature, that they which are not able to conduct their lives in a due manner, ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be directed by others. And hence aroſe the Inſtitution of Magiſtrates, to whom the Government of humane life is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; ſo that where the Magiſtrate interpoſes his injunction concerning ſuch things, his Law ought to be obeyed, as the counſel of a publique &amp;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:119039:166"/> ſuperiour Prudence, whom God and Nature have entruſted with the diſpenſation of ſuch things with ſuitable Authority: But the practice of them is no longer indifferent, when they are referr'd to Religion, and made a part of the ſervice of God; becauſe it belongs to God alone to make Laws in reference to his ſervice, and therefore to place his ſervice in things which he hath left as indifferent, would be to uſurp his place, and to invade his Authority. But this requires a more particular conſideration.</p>
               <p>Things wherein the ſervice of God conſiſts have a double reſpect; one, as they are accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God to whom they are performed, and obtain his favour; the other, as they oblige the Conſciences of men, upon the account of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Divine and Religious: Wherefore whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver takes upon him the Authority of enjoyning ſuch things for Religious, and requiſite to the ſervice of God, which are in their own nature free, and leſt by God in their indifference, he commits ſeveral high crimes in one ſingle at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: For he offers to make a thing, not at all ordained by God, a means to obtain his favour, and to be well-pleaſing to him. Now God is not delighted with things according to the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of man, but according to his own will. In the next place, he arrogates a dominion over the Conſcience, and encroaches upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God; for he places himſelf between him and that, though between God and the Conſcience of man there is no intermedium, no more then there is between husband and wife; and God communicates to men the power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:119039:167"/> that which concerns this life onely, whereby ſome are bound to yield obedience to others: But as for what relates to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he hath reſerv'd the Empire over it wholly to himſelf. In fine, he uſurps what is proper to none but the Deity, by claiming the right of giving the Nature and Eſſence to things, and making them of free and indifferent, as they were, to become good or bad: For it may be truly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it is as much in the power of men to create things of nothing, as it is to render ſuch good or evil which were not ſo before. In the one there is requiſite an infinite power, in the other an infinite authority; and conſequently, as it is not permitted to any to uſurp this right, ſo it is not lawful for any to obey him that uſurps it; that is, to account thoſe things for good by vertue of his Preſcription, which were before indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: Becauſe this would be to allow and favour a tyrannie in prejudice of the glory of God; to inthral his Conſcience, which God would have free in this regard; to pretend ſuch things are acceptable to him, which he hath not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to meaſure him according to our own will: In a word, to own for Divine and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious by humane command ſuch things as the wiſdom of God would have be eſteemed purely humane and indifferent.</p>
               <p>What then (will ſome ſay) is it not lawful for the Religious Society to eſtabliſh certain Laws and Ceremonies, which private perſons are bound to obſerve, when they are conſtituted by publique ſuffrage of the Society? or if God hath appointed certain perſons to be Governours of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:119039:167"/> this Society, as he hath placed the conduct of Juſtice in the hands of the Magiſtate, hath he not given them Authority to make Conſtitutions, concerning things in their own nature indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which oblige thoſe that are ſubject to their rule? Yes certainly, and we have touch'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove upon the manner how; but it will be here convenient to explain the ſame ſomewhat fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Magiſtrates in a Civil Society make two ſorts of Laws; in ſome they expound the very Laws of Nature onely, and do not conſtitute; as when they forbid Theft, Adultery, Murder, and Blaſphemy; for they are not the Authors of theſe Laws, they are onely the Proclaimers and Interpreters: So that when we obey them in this caſe, we do not ſo much obey them as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf. Others are ſuch as they judge profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for conſetvation of that Society, over which they ſuperintend, although they be not expreſly grounded upon the Dictates of Nature; ſuch are the Edicts concerning Commerce, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, Taxes and Gabels; which when they ordain, they onely advance, and have reſpect to the publique good, and do not pretend the ſame to be the Law of God or Nature: Whence when we obey them in this caſe, we have regard to them, and not to the nature it ſelf of the things; we do the ſame out of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their Authority, and the benefit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing thereby, namely, the conſervation of Society, and not as if theſe things were of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficient to be authentick and inviolable grounds of Laws. In like manner, they that are intruſted with the Government of the other
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:119039:168"/> Society, have the care of two ſorts of Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions committed to them. In the firſt of which, they onely expound the Laws of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are not Legiſlators, but meer Guardians and Depoſitaries; and when they promulgate the ſame, they do not pretend that they are their own Decrees, but the Ordinances of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: So that when we yield obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, it is not properly in reſpect to them, but becauſe of the expreſs command of God, and the very eſſence of the thing. The ſecond ſort is, of thoſe which they eſteem profitable onely in reference to order and ſeemlineſs, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Society which they govern, and do not recommend the ſame but under that title, and not as founded on the command of God; So that in ſubmitting to them, we have regard to the Authority which God hath given them concerning the ordering theſe affairs, and to the benefit ariſing thereby, as peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, by which the Society is preſerved: And ſo far ought they to be obeyed, when they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing more to themſelves. But when in either of theſe Societies, their Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents go about either to command and forbid, that which God and Nature have forbidden and commanded, or to change the very nature of things, or to impoſe their own Laws as Divine and Natural, we are not onely not bound to ſubmit unto, but commanded to reſiſt them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they ſet themſelves in the place of God, and inſtead of preſerving the Society, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and overthrow it. And from all this it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follows, that it is not lawful in theſe kinde
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:119039:168"/> of things, to have Communion in a Religion which thus tramples on the bounds wherewith <hi>God</hi> and Nature have circumſcrib'd it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there are ſome things, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in themſelves, are free, and of a middle nature, which yet are not ſo, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to a certain end, but are determined by the very nature of the thing to which they are deſign'd. For example, the knowledge of thoſe truths in which conſiſts the Wiſdom of Religion, is without doubt a thing good in it ſelf, and which God commands by the ſame Revelation whereby he hath declared them: To attain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, certain means muſt be employ'd, and there is no other then to expound them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in the moſt fitting and convenient manner that may be, as to be preſent in ſome places to hear ſuch as diſcourſe of them, to communicate thereof with them, in order to be reſolved of any difficulties that ariſe. Whence, though to reſort to a certain place at a time prefixed, be a thing purely free and indifferent, if conſidered preciſely and ſeparately in it ſelf, yet in caſe God had not expreſly commanded the ſame, the commandment of that which is ordained, as the ſcope and end, encludes alſo tacitely and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily that of the means which conduce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. By the ſame reaſon therefore things, which though free in themſelves, yet naturally refer to a bad end, and which is forbidden by God or Nature, ought to be accounted bad: For which cauſe, all Ceremonies which are in a falſe Religion, being deſtinated to an end bad of its own nature, and expreſly forbidden by God;
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:119039:169"/> whoſoever eſteems them indifferent, overthrows all the order and natural relation, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the end, and the means that lead unto it. For example, they with whom I treat at preſent, will not deny, but that amongſt all thoſe Nations which have been deſtitute of the particuler Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation which they confeſs neceſſary, there were divers that adored falſe gods, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Idolatry; but their Sacrifices, Myſteries, and Solemn Proceſſions, were things deſtinated to that ſervice rendred to falſe gods, as the means are deſtinated to their end; Therefore although the murdring of Beaſts, and the various grimaces and external geſtures of the body, and marching to Temples in great crouds, are indifferent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in themſelves; yet regard being had to the devotions to which they appertain'd; they were as ſeverely forbidden as Idolatry it ſelf; for it is the ſame caſe with this ſpiritual unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that of the body, the acceſſes &amp; approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Stews, viſits, &amp; wanton aſpects, becauſe they are the inveglements to incontinence, are forbidden by the ſame Laws of honeſty which forbid impudicity it ſelf. But though this general diſcourſe might perhaps be ſufficient, yet I ſhall not decline to bring into the liſts more particular reaſons that encounter this irreligious Indifference, examining one after another, all Religions that are at preſent, or ever were in the world.</p>

               <p>ALthough the different Sects of Religion have been almoſt infinite, every Nation by practicing ſome particular Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, diſtinguiſhing their own from that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yea, the ſame Nation ſometimes dividing into factions upon this occaſion; Yet generally all that ever bore any vogue in the world, may be reduced to four principal (each of which was reſpectively the ſtem from which all the reſt ſprung) namely, the <hi>Pagan,</hi> the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> For under the Pagan, I comprize all the Religions of the ancient <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> of the <hi>Druyds, Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Gymnoſophiſts,</hi> and the reſt, that had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor <hi>Mahomet,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their Religious Ceremonies: For, though as the mindes of men are different, they have varyed in this reſpect by ſome light circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, yet they all agree in what is eſſential, and make no ſcruple of communicating together in their myſteries. Under the <hi>Mahometan</hi> muſt
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:119039:170"/> be comprehended not onely that which is the National Religion of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that which is profeſſed by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> whom the <hi>Turks</hi> account Hereticks of their Law, and what other Sects ſoever there be of the ſame, As for the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> we muſt make diſtinction of it rather according to times then Sects, inaſmuch as though there was ſome times among the Jews ſome diverſity of profeſſion, between certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons addicted to devotion after a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as the <hi>Eſſeans,</hi> the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and <hi>Saduc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, their differences were not in the fundamental and princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cees,</hi> who denied the Reſurrection of the body, and the immortality of the Soul) but in certain inconſiderable matters, which chiefly concerned their rule of ordinary life; as Monks among the Chriſtians differ not in Religion from the people, but onely in a more auſtere and reſtrained manner of life. And though there were the <hi>Saducees</hi> that differed in principal points of Religion, nevertheleſs, as to external politie or government, they were all of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and had neither Temples nor Synagogues apart by themſelves. But indeed there hath been a great diverſity amongſt them, if we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſeveral times; for the Chriſtians not onely confeſs, that the ancient Jewiſh Religion was of Divine Inſtitution, and that God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Laws to that Nation alone, but prove the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:119039:170"/> ſame againſt the Pagans by irrefragable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. Nevertheleſs they ſay, that this Religion, in reference to what concerns the external ſervice of God, and the Law upon which it was founded, was but for a time, in expectation till the Chriſtian were fully reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereof the Jewiſh contained onely the types and ſhadows; And that the Chriſtian having been eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Meſſias</hi> really and <hi>de facto</hi> manifeſted in the fulneſs of time, from thenceforth all that ancient Worſhip is aboliſh'd, and hath given place to that which was to come in its room. The Jews on the contrary maintain, that that <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom the Chriſtians adore, is not the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but expect him ſtill to come, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and preſerving as much as they are able in their diſperſion, that ancient Law, although they have very much altered the Doctrine of their Anceſtors: Therefore I call that the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Religion, which the Jews profeſs at this day. Laſtly, by the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> though it alſo be divided into ſeveral parties (from which it hath been as little able to warrant it ſelf as the reſt, nor to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the rent of Sectaries) I underſtand here onely theſe two, under which all others may be ranked; namely, Thoſe who acknowledge no other Revelation of the will of God, but that which is found written in the Book called the Bible; and thoſe, who beſides that Book, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as Divine Revelation, certain Doctrines which they affirm to have been left by tradition from the firſt birth of Chriſtianity, and continued along unto the preſent times; which they call, The unwritten Word. For as for certain He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:119039:171"/> equally deteſted by both parties, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Divinity of Chriſt, the Author of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they are juſtly accounted undeſerving of the name of Chriſtians, becauſe they take away the Baſis upon which all the Chriſtian Doctrine is founded. Let us now examine, whether the Doctrine of Indifference, be competible with any of theſe Religions, and to which of them the commendation of being Divine of right belongs.</p>
               <p>As for the Pagan, it is true indeed, the <hi>Greeks</hi> might well partake in the myſteries of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> in thoſe of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they all ſerved almoſt the ſame gods, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they gave them different names, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times followed diſtinct forms of Ceremonies. And in truth, we ſee not that they made any ſcruple of conſcience in ſo doing: For though the Philoſophers ſhould have been more ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous herein then the vulgar, inaſmuch as they ought to have had more knowledge of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Deity; yet we do not read that <hi>Plato</hi> in his travels into <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Sicile,</hi> ſeparated from the Communion which the Inhabitants of the places had in the Ceremonies of the Country, how different ſoever they were from thoſe of <hi>Greece.</hi> And in all thoſe great Peregrinations which <hi>Phileſtratus</hi> relates <hi>Apollonius Thyanaus</hi> to have made, both into <hi>India, Ethiopia, Italy, Spain, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> we do not finde that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes the honour to the gods of every Nation which they performed to them, but generally conforms thereunto, reforming and amending after his own fancy the defects which he found in ſome ſlight circumſtances onely, changing
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:119039:171"/> none throughtout either in Doctrine, or the body of their Myſteries. And if he abſtains from communicating in the Sacrifices of beaſts and living things, it was onely by reaſon of the whimſey of the Metempſychoſis, which he had cloſely embraced from the Sect of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> to whom it was peculiar. For the reſt, he leſt to <hi>Jupiter, Venus, Bacchus,</hi> and the other gods, their Temples, Statues, and Altars, and all their Myſteries, and would have us account him a more Religious Obſerver of them then any other perſon in the world. But however, none of them all would ever believe it lawful for them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the Jewiſh Religion, or have any participation in the Ceremonies of the Chriſtians, ſince they all accuſe them of Idolatry, and their gods of vanity, and this with ſtrange reproaches, calling them people without God, and thoſe whom they adored, gods of dung and filth. For either the Jews and Chriſtian ſay true in this point, or not: If they do not ſay true, but the Pagan Religion is of Divine Inſtitution, then the Chriſtians themſelves are Idolaters. Now there is no likelihood, that a Religion of Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ſhould permit communion in the ſervice of falſe gods; for, as I ſaid above, Religion is as the marriage of God with the ſoul, If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God himſelf permits commerce with falſe gods, it is as if a man ſhould permit his wiſe to proſtitute her felf to others; whereby he would ſhew himſelf both too groſs and ſtupid a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his own right, a too ſordid prizer of the honeſty of marriage, and too unworthy of the faith of a true and loyal Spouſe. If they ſay
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:119039:172"/> true, the teſtimony of the Pagan Religion ought not to be valued, whatever it be. But beſides, it would not be reaſon for the Pagans, who do not believe it, to condeſcend the leaſt in the world to the Chriſtian Religion, ſince it does ſo much miſchief and outrage to the gods they adore. For what man is there that hath never ſo little natural affection, or if natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affections be poſſibly dryed up in him, ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhame leſt in his face, as to dare pronounce it lawful for him to entertain a friendſhip either true or feigned, with ſuch perſons as have a ſworn irreconcileable enmity againſt his father: yea, who would not reſent it in point of honour, to hear his friend defamed in his preſence? Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine then what good devotion a Gentile could have, at the prayers which we make to God for the deſtruction and confuſion of all thoſe falſe Deities whom the Gentiles worſhip: For if he believes neither in our God, nor his own, he is no longer a Gentile, but an Atheiſt; if he believe in his own, can he have the heart to bow his knee and pronounce Amen to ſuch Prayers of ours?</p>
               <p>Indeed we finde it in ſome place or other, where <hi>Socrates</hi> counſels every man to ſerve God according to the mode of his own Country. But this counſel proceeded partly from ignorance of the true God, and deſpair of ever being able to comprehend his nature; becauſe it being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally imprinted in the minde of man, that he ought to honour him, and the manner of doing it agreeably being unknown to <hi>Socrates,</hi> he had no further to adviſe, then to ſerve him at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of hapning right or not: Like as a man that
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:119039:172"/> had caſt his net a hundred and a hundred times in places noted for fiſhing without catching any thing, ſhould at length in choler and deſpair, caſt it into the next place he came to, though it were upon the ſand or rocks. So the Painter in rage threw his ſpung againſt his Picture, becauſe he could not pleaſe himſelf in repreſenting to the life the foam of a horſes mouth that he was paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Partly alſo, becauſe all the Devotions of the <hi>Greeks</hi> had ſuch a reſemblance between them, that as the Dialects of their Language, and the faſhions of their attire, how various ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, always retained the <hi>Greek</hi> aire and mode; ſo likewiſe, though in the manner of ſerving God they varied in ſome things of leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet in the judgement of this Perſon it was at the bottom indifferent to which of them to conform. And whereas he had never travelled, he conceived the opinion concerning the Deity and his ſervice was alike almoſt in all Nations. But had he heard the Jews ſpeak, without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he would have either deſpiſed the gods of the Pagans, or abhorr'd the Jews, who utterr'd ſuch hainous reproaches againſt them. Truly, the conſtancy which this Perſon ſhew'd at his death, and that admirable proteſtation he made, (That he would not ceaſe to teach Philoſophy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Athenians,</hi> not even for the hope of life, inaſmuch as he conceiv'd himſelf raiſed up by God to reform the manners of his fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens by Philoſophy) clearly evinces, that if he had had any certainty in Religion, and particular revelation of the will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his ſervice, he would not have deviated
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:119039:173"/> from it in the leaſt, much leſs would he have mingled himſelf indifferently in all ſorts of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Wherefore in that he adviſed every man to comply with the Religion of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it appears that he did not believe the form of Religion received amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> to have been of Divine Inſtitution; but being otherwiſe a man of peace, and politick, he would not have received cuſtoms infringed, for fears of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Commonwealth. Certainly, if the Pagans had believ'd the profeſſion of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons indifferent, the <hi>Romans</hi> would never have perſecuted the Chriſtians and Jews with ſuch extremity, nor endeavour'd to conſtrain them by ſuch rigorous torments, to ſacrifice to their gods, and communicate in their myſteries; they would not have ſhewn themſelves ſo violent for the extinguiſhment of Chriſtianity in their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, nor made ſuch diligent inquiſition after the Books which we hold for ſacred, to aboliſh the memory thereof. And if <hi>Julian</hi> ſirnamed the Apoſtate, famous amongſt the Pagans for his knowledge in Philoſophy, had been of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he would not have renounced the name of Chriſtian, for the ſervice of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and other Pagan Deities; nor after he had revolted, would he have ſhewn himſelf ſo irreconcileable an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my thereunto: And the ſame may be likewiſe ſaid of the other Philoſophers, who in his time and before, oppugned the Religion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians with ſo great aſperity and violence. They would without queſtion have been more gentle and tractable, had they had any intelligence of this complacential Indifference.</p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:119039:173"/>
               <p>Now whether the Pagan Religion favored this Indifference, or not (which yet experience and reaſon decides in the negative) it was ſo vain and falſe, that no account ought to be made of its ſuffrage. And I cannot imagine that there is any at this day, that bears the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who eſteems it to have been of Divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. Wherefore the little I ſhall ſay to prove it, is not ſo much for neceſſity of the thing in it ſelf, as becauſe the deſign of this work does not permit me to paſs it over abſolutely in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. To judge therefore what it was, we muſt not conceive it ſuch as it is amongſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſavage Nations, ſuch as the <hi>Toupinam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boults</hi> are at preſent, and the people of <hi>Suevia</hi> and <hi>Sarmatia</hi> were of old. For who will believe that any extraordinary Celeſtial light in matter of Religion ever illuminated thoſe Nations, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom there is ſcarce ſeen any traces of ſo much as humanity? It is true, there have been ſome people in our times, that have written ſo highly in commendation of the contentment there is in their opinion, in living under the ſimple Laws of nature, as they ſpeak, that they ſeem inclinable to favour the manners and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Savages, and prefer it before ours; ſo as to have no ſhame at all of their nakedneſs, and to boaſt that they do not cover it, but onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to cuſtom. But as for theſe perſons, it is not my preſent purpoſe to diſpute againſt them. If they would ſpeak the genuine ſentiments of their hearts, they would not onely not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any particular revelation of the will of God in Religion, but would moreover make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:119039:174"/> of not believing the immortality of their ſouls, nor any Religion in the world; and after having rendred themſelves like to thoſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Savages in all brutalities, they would ſurpaſs them in this point, that they would caſt under their feet all remembrance of God, of whom in their Deſarts and forlorn Barbariſm, the <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jats</hi> and <hi>Patagons</hi> have yet ſome fear and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. I ſpeak now to ſuch as make ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of the improving elegancy of Learning, and who have ſome portion of honeſty leſt in their converſation amongſt men. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> therefore have without queſtion carried the preheminence in all kindes of polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and excellence amongſt the Pagan Nations. So that it is amongſt them that we muſt ſeek for this particular revelation, whether it may be found in the Religion of either of thoſe people. It is true, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were much celebrated for their myſteries and rare wiſdom, and divers have thought that all the wiſdom of <hi>Greece</hi> was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported from the treaſuries of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by thoſe that travell'd thither for it. But if there were any thing of good among them, they had it from communication with the Jews, who beſides that they ſojourned a long time in <hi>Egypt</hi> before the <hi>Greek</hi> name aroſe in the world, they were their neer neighbours in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and free commerce with them: yet have they ſo viciated, corrupted and obſcured in their ſuperſtitions and idolatries, what they had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, that there is none of it to be known and diſtinguiſh'd, &amp; almoſt all the books in which they had expounded their myſteries are
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:119039:174"/> loſt. But he that is deſirous to know what excellent opinions they had, what divine wiſdom it was that made them ſo cryed up, he may pleaſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to read the Treatiſe written by <hi>Plutark</hi> of <hi>Iſis</hi> and <hi>Oſiris,</hi> and he will ſee in the firſt place that the veiles and allegories under which he ſayes they hid their knowledge, are ſhameful and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid fables, ſuch idle and dull extravagancies and impertinences in themſelves, that it is impoſſible they could ſerve for a coverture to any concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I do not ſay heavenly and divine, but worthy of men and ordinary ſober ſenſe. In the next place he will finde, that all that <hi>Plutark</hi> with ſingular acuteneſs of wit could uncypher of them, is ſo dubious, and the text on which he comments ſo plyable to all ſorts of fancies, that he that would ſet himſelf about it, might invent ſeveral other interpretations as probable as his. They are as the divers impreſſions of clouds, to which the fancy of every man aſcribes what image or lineaments ſeems beſt to him. And laſtly, he will diſcover, that though the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions which that Philoſopher preſents us there, were as certain as if they had been delivered by an Oracle, yet they all terminate in two caitive and diſmal Demons, unknown even to them that ador'd them; in uncouch ſpeculations concerning the motions of the Moon and the Inundations of <hi>Nilus;</hi> in Platonick Idea's, and the Riddles of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and in that ancient foppery of <hi>Oromaſdes</hi> and <hi>Arimanius,</hi> two oppoſite principles of all things, with ſome cold myſtical interpretations of reaſons why the <hi>Egyptians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly worſhipped the Ox, the Sheep, the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:119039:175"/> Ichneumon, Larks, Storks, Serpents, Dogs, Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Weeſels. Is not here great cauſe to boaſt of having drawn from the fountain of Divine Wiſdom it ſelf? So little ground is there to think ſo, that on the contrary, there is no perſon of indifferent underſtanding, but in the reading of that Treatiſe would pity <hi>Plutark,</hi> that beſtowed ſo much knowledge and labour in commenting upon ſuch abſurdities, and could not diſcover them to be ſuch. What ſhall we then ſay of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who held from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> whatever they had not altogether bad? and what ſhall we think of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had nothing but from imitation of the Greeks, both in humane Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Religious Politie?</p>
               <p>But put the caſe they had borrowed nothing from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but that this Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been peculiarly imparted to them, I would be told from what books that were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation amongſt them, we ought now to take it. For we have heard ſay indeed, that they had Sibyls, by whoſe means they were made acquainted with divine ſecrets, and who alſo writ books of the ſame, but the wind and time have carried them away. If there be any thing leſt of their Oracles (as there are divers excellent Greek verſes that bear their name at this day, yet are with very juſt reaſon ſuſpected by the learned) the Chriſtian Religion is clearly deſcribed in them, and the Pagan ſo ſtrongly and directly confuted, that the Chriſtians could ſcarce finde more expreſs proofs for themſelves, then in thoſe books of theirs. And there is no likelihood that theſe were the ſame whom the Roman Prieſts
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:119039:175"/> went to conſult, as oft as there was occaſion to avert ſome raging mortality. For they taught not to render to <hi>Apollo, Latona, Diana, Hercules, Mercury</hi> or <hi>Neptune,</hi> thoſe honours which they us'd to perform to them, to make them propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ſuch occurrences. If therefore this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was contained in the Books of the Sibyls, it is periſh'd long ſince, and we have no more knowledge of them, then of thoſe of <hi>Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius,</hi> which were burned at <hi>Rome</hi> by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Senate,</hi> becauſe they tended to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and annulling of all their Religious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. They had moreover memorials of the rights of the Pontifices, Augurs, and Aruſpices. Of all which there is nothing left but the name. Miſerable are we, if the truth was there; of which we are in deſpair ever to have any intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. Shall we then have recourſe to find it in the books of the Poets? Truely it would be an excellent deſign to go about to build a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the model afforded us in the Theology of <hi>Heſiod,</hi> the Hymmes of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> the Poems of <hi>Homer,</hi> the Odes of <hi>Pindar,</hi> the Metamorphoſes of <hi>Ovid,</hi> and the divine Theology of the great <hi>Virgil,</hi> who is ſo hard put to it to ſave the gods of the poor <hi>Aeneas</hi> from the ſack of <hi>Troy,</hi> and who truſſes them up in the ſame fardel with the little <hi>Aſcanius</hi> as companions of the ſame fortune. It were more rationally credible that the beaſts and trees held that rare converſe together which <hi>Aeſop</hi> reports of them in his Fables, then to give belief to the adventures and exploits which thoſe Poets aſcribe to their Deities. For in the firſt there would be nothing but childiſhneſs or at
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:119039:176"/> moſt but brutiſhneſs, in the latter impiety and blaſphemy. And if, as ſome would have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd of them (though perhaps themſelves never thought of any ſuch matter) their intent was to cover under the veil of thoſe fables ſeveral true myſteries pertaining to the knowledge of the Deity and underſtanding of the ſecrets of nature, ſo far was the teaching the ſame after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from being a divine intention, that on the contrary the honor of the Deity hath thereby been unworthily impaired and the truth ſmoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd under moſt horrible lies. It follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we go to the writings of Philoſophers, to which we cannot without great injury to truth aſcribe the commendation of being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from celeſtial inſpiration, ſince the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors themſelves, though ſufficiently preſumtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, do not pretend they were ſo. And indeed we have ſhewn above that they were either wholly ignorant of the requiſites to a true piety towards God, or if they had knowledge of ſome few it was wonderfully obſcure and dubious. But how could the revelation of God have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to groap and wander in that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance! To conclude, is it then to thoſe Oracles of <hi>Delphos, Dodona, Jupiter Ammon,</hi> and others the like, that we owe the glory of this divine knowledge? Truly, it moves both ſhame and pity, to hear themſelves ſpeak both of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and faculty of divination, and ceſſation of Oracles. It was a heard of Goats that firſt brought that of <hi>Delphos,</hi> which was the moſt famous and venerable of all, into reputation. But the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that were placed there to give anſwers to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:119039:176"/> inquirers, which they receiv'd by their obſcene parts, were not long there, but there ariſe moſt notorious ſcandals of them. All their predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ambiguous and doubtful, like our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack-makers, who propheſie by hap-hazard; and themſelves gave this account of it; that the Daemons which ſpoke there not knowing things to come but by inſpection of the Stars, and ſo being able to gather from thence but incertain conjectures, they ſhrouded their ignorance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ambiguity of words capable of different interpretations, to the end they might make good their credit whatſoever the event of things might be. In a word, af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er <hi>Plutark</hi> had beſtirr'd himſelf on all ſides to finde out the cauſes of theſe Oracles and their ceaſing, and ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd them periſhable and mortal Daemons, ſometimes immortal, but that they chang'd place, he ſeems to reſolve upon this worthy Philoſophy. That the earth was in ſome places indued with certain prophetick Virtues, which come by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations to be mingled and inſinuated into ſouls fitting to receive thoſe inſpirations, and ſo cauſe in them thoſe Enthuſiaſmes and predictions of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things: Afterwards, when all the virtue is ſpent, and the whole maſs that was made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the ſubterranean caverns, evaporated, then the prediction that was made by the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of things to come, ceaſes and is extinguiſh'd. Without queſtion thoſe divinations could not but be very clear, which proceeded onely from the fumes of the earth, and the religious devotions very good that were paid to theſe divining exhalations and the perſons who received
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:119039:177"/> the impreſſions of them in their ſouls.</p>
               <p>But perhaps though the evidences of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation be loſt, I mean the books in which it was recorded, yet it ha's remained in the memory of man, and is preſerved by practiſe as by a living tranſcript. Be it ſo. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now examine the Pagan Religion in it ſelf. Which certainly if it was divine, ought to have afforded a great knowledge of thoſe ſupreme truths, in the underſtanding of which conſiſts the perfection of our ſouls. And yet it ha's been pitifully defective herein. For ſetting a part at preſent thoſe principles of Chriſtian Religion, which ſeem moſt incredible, and by reaſon of which profane men reject or ſuſpect it, there is no perſon that ha's a dram of common ſenſe but will freely confeſs that we have beyond compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon more knowledge of the nature of the Deity and true virtue, then the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> ever had, which notwithſtanding we have drawn from books more ancient then them by many ages, and which condemn the Gods of all other Nations. Whence therefore came it to paſs, that if they had that particular revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we enquire after, they were ſo ignorant of thoſe indubitable truths, of which we are ſo knowing, who have learnt the ſame from thoſe that are profeſs'd enemies to the Pagan Deities? If what they believ'd in matter of Religion was truth, whence do thoſe truths which we perceive now ſo clearly and comprehend ſo certainly, convince them of falſhood? And if the Gods which the Pagans ador'd were true Gods, why do the books which have taught us ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:119039:177"/> things whereunto humane reaſon cannot repugne, call them Gods of clay?</p>
               <p>And indeed they were marveillous Gods; for even thoſe that ador'd them knew their parents, and could ſhew their tombes, and tell a thouſand debaucheries of them; which confirm that they were ſo far from being worthy to reign in the heavens, that on the contrary they deſerved publick puniſhment upon earth. Their thefts, their rapes and adulteries, their attempts againſt parents, their whoredoms, whereby, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their authors, they filled the heavens with baſtards, their Sodomies and inceſts would not have been ſuffered unpuniſh'd by thoſe that built Temples and Altars to them, if they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended them in the juriſdiction of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Republicks. And the ſupreme <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf muſt not be excepted, of whom <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> exclaimed with more reaſon then he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agin'd,

Whoſoever (ſaith <hi>Plutark</hi>) would ſearch into the hiſtories of the times that preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> ſhall find therein nothing
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:119039:178"/> but vaſt and unknown ſolitudes, deſerts, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths and abyſſes; where nothing occurs to fix and arreſt his wandring thoughts. And the reaſon is becauſe the moſt ancient people having for a good time retained ſome memory of their original and of the true God, it diminiſh't and vaniſh't by little and little till there remain'd no more of it in the World but the bare name; and ſo thoſe that came after not knowing to whom they ought to aſcribe it, they imputed it to them who had moſt endeared themſelves to their love by their benefits or rendred themſelves moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtable by arms. Whence it was that <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> in <hi>Ennius</hi> utters this brave language,

                  </q> But had not the lateneſs of their original and the debauchedneſs of their manners been ſo well known, yet their multitude renders them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. For they had ſome high, ſome low, and ſome of middle ranke; ſome kept their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Heavens, others in the Earth, and in the Sea, and Rivers; and ſome under the barks of Trees and in Chimney-corners. They had of one ſort for their corn, and another for their cattel, others for tuition of their houſes, for arts, ſwords, and diſeaſes. Honor, Virtue, the Fever, Fear and Victory, were conſecrated and deified by them promiſcuouſly; and even the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:119039:178"/> regions had their Deities, to the end there might be no corner in the world either above or below deſtitute of them.</p>
               <p>Peradventure ſome will here take occaſion to interpoſe two things: Firſt that the wiſer ſort amongſt them did not believe this multiplicity of Gods; and Secondly, that they that did believe it, acknowledged one ſupreme over the reſt, and to whom they were as ſubalternate Deities. But this makes nothing againſt us. For, as to the firſt objection, we ſpeak here of the form of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion eſtabliſh'd amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> and not of the opinions of ſuch or ſuch Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. If ſome have had peculiar conceptions dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe of the people, this was not by reaſon of any ſpecial revelation, but through the natural ſtrength of their minds which could not approve all that rabble of Divinityes which were in reverence with the vulgar. Beſides, we have ſhewn that all thoſe particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts were of extreme little worth, and that what they contained of truth was intricat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confuſed in a Chaos of lyes. In the next place, no Religions authoriſed by the conſent of thoſe Nations were founded upon thoſe truths. If one perſon produc'd any thing of that kind into the publike, the people became immediately his enemies, as if he purpoſed the overthrow and deſtruction of Religion. Their opinion is probable who think the ſole cauſe of <hi>Luhemerus</hi>'s being branded with the name of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, was his writing the hiſtory of thoſe falſe Gods and diſcovering their ſhame to all the world; not that he peremptorily and flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:119039:179"/> the Deity. Even the perſons to whom thoſe better ſentiments were peculiar, never had, to ſpeak ſtrictly, any deſign of reforming the world, or reclaiming it from Idolatry and Superſtitions. Themſelves conformed thereunto, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the ſame as others did; becauſe the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they perceived of truth was ſo dubicus, that it could not give them courage to oppoſe boldly the common received apprehenſions; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Plato's</hi> books <hi>De Republica,</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for <hi>Socrates</hi> contained therein. For do's not he well prove that he believ'd there were more Gods, ſince he believ'd the Gods had children; the name of ſon preſuppoſing the exiſtence of a father? Is not this a rare ratiocination for ſo great a Philoſopher? And how does he defend himſelf againſt the accuſation of attempting to alter the Religion of his Country? No otherwiſe then by a flat denyal; though he was a perſon whom the fear of death could not have induc'd to diſſemble a truth which he certainly knew, as appears ſufficiently by the iſſue of his caſe. For the ſecond; In truth I doubt not but thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Pagans which had the leaſt meaſure of underſtanding, aſſerted ſome ſupreme Deity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all thoſe diminutive ones, of which ſome reckon five and twenty or thirty thouſand. Thus <hi>Homer</hi> makes his <hi>Jupiter</hi> utter this rodomontado, that ſhould all the Gods together draw at one end of a chain, and he himſelf at the other, he could hoiſe them all up in ſpight of their reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy. Whereby it appears he had a higher opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him then of the reſt; though he ſaies in another place, that had it not been for <hi>Briareus</hi>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:119039:179"/> who came to his ſuccor upon the requeſt of <hi>Thetis, Jupiter</hi> had been bound by the other Gods, who had complotted to that purpoſe together againſt him. But what is the gueſs or hariola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two or three to the conſtant opinions of a whole multitude? Or what is it conſiderable, if ſeveral perſons have had theſe particular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, ſeeing they generally followed a contrary practiſe in Religion? And this is atteſted by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. What defect do they charge upon the other Gods, which they do not likewiſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to <hi>Jupiter?</hi> What honour do they afford him, which they do not alſo allow to the reſt? Do they erect more Statues or burn oftner and larger portions of incenſe to him? Do they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate more Altars to him or build him a greater number of Temples? Do they give leſs credit to the Oracles of <hi>Apollo</hi> then to his, or make leſs account of his ceremonies? Are the reſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd to by them with leſs reverence, or are they more ſparing in giving them the title of Gods? Have they rather recourſe to him in their afflictions? Do they render leſs praiſe to the others for victories which they obtain in battel? Whoſo reads their hiſtories, will find the other Gods as much praiſed, magnifi'd, ſacrific'd to, adored, thanked and venerated as <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and if they allow him ſome priority in ſpeaking, as we do to the Preſident of a Council, yet in effect they equal all the others to him. But let them, if they pleaſe, place him in the higheſt throne in the heavens: what celeſtial revelation is that which multiplies Deities to millions? Certainly, if there be a Deity, it is infinite both in effence
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:119039:180"/> and power; if it be infinite, it is one, and ſuffers no companion or equal: If God be ſufficient alone for the government of the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, for what end were all theſe little pygmy-Gods, but onely to diſtract the minds of men from the true and ſupream Deity to them? And if he be not ſufficient, how is he himſelf God who is ſo defective in his power? If the others be not Gods, but onely Daemons, either good or evil, creatures of the ſoverain God and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his commands, then are thoſe mortals idolaters that aſcribe to them that title and glory; and by conſequence their Religion is either hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or rather diabolical, certainly far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divine, as they pretend.</p>
               <p>But, alas, this is an <hi>Augean</hi> Stable. Though there ſhould be ſome ſmall Deities inferior to the ſupreme (which yet right reaſon abhors) yet He ought to be of a majeſty ſo glorious, and of an eſſence and power ſo immenſe, as we have ſhewn above, that no corporeal image either by the hand in braſs, or marble, or even by the mind in the fancy, can be framed of him. In as much as all corporeal figure not onely determines and limits the ſubject which it repreſents, but always refers it to the proportion of the thing it ſelf under the figure whereof it is repreſented. Now how abominable was the idolatry of the Pagans in this reſpect? The <hi>Egyptians</hi> repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Deity under the figure of beaſts, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius</hi> in <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> blames their Gymnoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts for it. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> thought they did more ſutably to repreſent him under a humane figure. How came this to paſs, but only
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:119039:180"/> becauſe they imagin'd that God reſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that there was a proportion as it were of greater and leſs between them and him? And was it not upon this apprehenſion that they were ſo forward to attribute the name of God to men, as to Kings, Emperors, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and that they dedicated Temples and Altars to them, and burnt incenſe to their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues? Wretched worms of the earth, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they could comprehend what God is, and meaſure him by their fadom! To make Gods at their pleaſure, and to become Gods themſelves! But that which was moſt of all pernitious to them was the conſecration of their Idols, into which by means of certain invocations they conceiv'd they could attract ſome portion of the eſſence of the Deity, or cauſe ſome extraordinary vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to deſcend from him into their images; after which they look'd not upon them as meer Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, but as things partaking of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf. For under this pretext Daemons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into them, making them ſometimes ſpeak intelligibly ſometimes weep, ſweat, bleed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from their places, clatter their weapons, and practis'd divers other kinds of illuſions in them, whereby the poor people were enchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and conceiv'd the ſame opinion of them, as if they had had the Deity it ſelf lodged in their Temples. Thus the evil Spirit exercis'd an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dominion amongſt them. In ſhort, it is an abuſe of time to ſpend many words in ſhewing that all their opinions in this matter were falſe, their myſteries wicked, their obſervations fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, and the ſervice which they rendred to
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:119039:181"/> their Gods full of Idolatry. Their ſacrifices were oftentimes barbarous and inhumane, for not onely the <hi>Maſſagetes,</hi> the <hi>Phoenicians, Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians, Perſians,</hi> and ſome other leſs civilis'd na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi> and <hi>Gaules,</hi> whoſe Druydes were in great eſteem, offer'd victimes of living men, yea ſome their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to their falſe Gods, as if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd God delighted to feed on their entrails. And who ſees not that it was the devil, who is a murderer from the beginning, that incited them to thoſe ſo lamentable bloody devotions. Their myſteries rendred men furious and frantick: for with what a ſpirit were thoſe enraged women agitated after their devotions in the Bacchanal feſtivals? Their auguries by the flight of birds, their preſages by the ſmoke of incenſe and the fat of their ſacrifices, and by inſpection of the intrals of immolated beaſts were ſo abſurd, that they ſeem to have been invented in deriſion of thoſe that applyed themſelves to them, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue that the learned <hi>Greeks</hi> and prudent <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> how great perſonages ſoever they thought themſelves, had not much wiſdom in the heart, as One of themſelves ſometimes ſaid, ſince they ſought it in the liver of beaſts. Then for their ceremonies, there is nothing more inept and ridiculous. Was it not excellent to hear the <hi>Curetes</hi> and <hi>Corybantes</hi> when they were in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, ſome of them drumming upon Kettles, ſome upon Bucklers, and Helmets, and others gingling chains and Cymbals? Their manners of celebration were diſhoneſt and unbecoming. For how could they but be aſham'd both of thoſe
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:119039:181"/> dances of naked men about tombes and of the races of naked men in the publick places of the Cities, yea at the meeting of women in the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percalia?</hi> Their propitiations, purifications and oblations were unprofitable and inefficacious. For what could the death of poor beaſts do in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to appeaſing the anger of God? It was not they which had offended, nor did it belong to them to bear the puniſhment. If their blood had had the virtue of making propitiation for ſins, the rich however otherwiſe wicked, were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that were able to offer hecatombs. And what efficacy was there in the aſperſion of cold water to cleanſe the conſcience of man from his crimes? Certainly with good reaſon did One amongſt them write,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Ah! nimium faciles, qui triſtia funera caedis</hi>

                     <l>To cleanſe away the horrid guilt of blood.</l>
                  </q> Their miracles were for the moſt part illuſions of Daemons; as the Serpent adored for <hi>AEſculapius</hi> in the City of <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> and afterwards carried to <hi>Rome</hi> to aſſwage the peſtilence; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> relating the tidings of the defeat of <hi>Perſeus</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and all the ſpeakings and ſweatings of Images in their Temples. Or elſe they were tricks of Magick: as that of <hi>Appius Navius,</hi> who to gain credit to his Auguries, cut a Whetſtone in two with a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor in the preſence of <hi>Romulus;</hi> and alſo that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:119039:182"/> manner of appeaſing a raging plague in the City of <hi>Epheſus</hi> practis'd by <hi>Apollonius</hi> of knocking down a Daemon with ſtones, and his vaniſhing before <hi>Domitian,</hi> and all thoſe jugling ſleights that were done before him when he was at a feaſt with the <hi>Brachmans</hi> of <hi>India.</hi> Or they were ſimple gulleries; as that of the inundation of the Lake of <hi>Alba.</hi> The inventors of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions were crafty men, who abuſed the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of the people to render them plyable to their laws, and more reſpectful to their perſons, as themſelves confeſs of <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Minos</hi> at <hi>Crete,</hi> and ſome others. The moſt ſeemingly devout ſectators of their Religions were very frequently contemners of them in the bottom of their hearts, though outwardly they put on a grave countenance to retain the affection of the vulgar; as <hi>Cotta,</hi> who in the books written by <hi>Cicero de Natura Deorum,</hi> ſayes that Religions muſt be preſerved in the ſtate they were at firſt inſtituted for the conſervation of Commonwealths, but that otherwiſe wiſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple laugh privately at all thoſe myſteries; which was very religiouſly ſpoken by a <hi>Pontifex Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Or they were ſhamefully ſuperſtitious. For was it not gravely done of <hi>Fab. Maximus</hi> and <hi>C. Flaminius,</hi> one to depoſe himſelf from the Dictatorſhip and the other from the Maſterſhip of the Horſe, becauſe a Mouſe made a noiſe in the time of their inſtallation; and of the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> to call home <hi>Figulus</hi> out of <hi>Gallia</hi> and <hi>Scipio Naſica</hi> out of the Iſland of <hi>Corſica</hi> to abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Conſulſhip, becauſe <hi>Tiberus Gracchus</hi> had obſerved in the books of Augurs that they
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:119039:182"/> were created contrary to the cuſtome, and that the pavillions were not rightly placed in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Aſſemblies. Laſtly, the means us'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and propagate this Religion were meerly humane, as wars, conſpiracies, encroachments, invaſions, ſieges of places and battels. For how did the <hi>Romanes</hi> impoſe other Gods upon other Nations but by force of Arms? And how did they poſſeſs the Gods of their people but as ſpoiles of their enemies and trophies of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories? Whereas, as we ſhall ſee hereafter, it was overthrown and ruin'd without a blow ſtrucken, after a moſt wonderful manner.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Whether the Profeſſion of all Religions be Indifferent according to the Religion of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And that this Religion is not of Divine Inſtitution.</head>
               <p>IT is of ſome difficulty to know certainly what was the opinion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion, concerning this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Whether the Profeſſion of all Religions be Indifferent? For he ſeems ſometimes to affirm it: as when he ſays in the Chapter of the Fable, That <hi>Jews, Samaritans, Chriſtians,</hi> all that ſhall have truſted in God and believed the Reſurrection of the Dead, and done good Works, ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from affliction, and they ſhall have nothing to fear at the day of Judgement. Sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he denies it: as when in the ſame Chapter and Page he ſaies, Certainly they which ſay that <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Mary,</hi> is God, are impious; and the entrance into Paradiſe is forbidden to him that ſays God hath a companion equal to himſelf, but hell ſhall be his habitation. Which Aſſertions are manifeſtly contradictory. And he is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alike unconſtant and fluctuating. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he promiſes the grace of God to all thoſe that do good works, provided they believe the unity of the Deity; a thing which he is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:119039:183"/> in recommending. And ſometimes he ſayes that his Law is the onely way of truth and ſalvation, and almoſt every where he teaches to promote it by force of Arms; which does not well conſiſt with his former maxime. For if all Religions equally endear to God and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, what neceſſity is there of ſo many bloody wars for the propagation of Mahometiſme? In truth it would be a ſtrange thing if a good Muſulman ſhould think his ſalvation ſecur'd in the profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, which cenſures <hi>Mahomet</hi> for the greateſt and moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Deceiver, that ever liv'd upon the Earth, and his Alcoran for a piece of unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell'd impoſture and execrable impiety; or if he ſhould partake in a communion where they pray continually for the deſtruction of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Turke,</hi> and the extirpation of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion. It is poſſible he might dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly explicate his meaning by this diſtinction, whereof there are ſome ſhadows frequently in his book; That if a perſon who once embraced the faith, afterwards happen to relapſe from or renounce the ſame by conſtraint, yet he ſhall not be condemned, provided he retain the ſame in his heart: but if he do it voluntarily and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violence, he ſhall never be redreſſed or reſtored into the right way by God, but ſhall be adjudged unto eternal pains. And it is well known, that whatever the Alcoran ſaies to the contrary, The <hi>Turkes</hi> hold the <hi>Perſians</hi> for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally damn'd, as hereticks of their Law, though they conſent in the principal points of the ſame, and both unanimouſly hold that impoſtor for a
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:119039:184"/> ſupreme Prophet. But as to matter of life and ordinary practiſe, there is no people under the Sun more ſcrupulous in obſervation of things which they account as making part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or come neer it within a hundred leagues; as not to imploy any paper to unclean uſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Alcoran is written in it, and other ſuch niceties, which ſpeak them indeed ſufficiently fooliſh, but otherwiſe exact obſervers of their moſt minute ceremonies. Their publike prayers are conſtantly frequented, &amp; their private never neglected. Their Faſts are ſtrict and inviolable; and ſeeing they condemn the uſe of Wine as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable, how can they be indifferent in other things more eſſential and important to Religion? Certainly though Chriſtians have without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon better grounds for this pretenſion, that the truth is on their ſide, yet they are nothing neer ſo paſſionate for the promoting of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as the <hi>Turks</hi> are for the propagation of the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> For they invite Chriſtians to them by great rewards; they favour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance renegadoes: and when a war is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, they are wonderfully zealous and ardent therein, if there be hope of extending their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, further thereby, and planting it amongſt the Nations which they invade. Which alſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſo obſtinate in retaining, that it is very ordinary to find amongſt them great numbers of perſons that have abandoned the name of Chriſt; but to ſee converted <hi>Turks</hi> in Chriſtendom, is a thing then which nothing is more rare: Yea there have been ſome who have rather choſen to ſuffer an ignominious death, then to accept of a pardon
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:119039:184"/> for notorious crimes committed by them, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of being baptiſed.</p>
               <p>But admit that <hi>Mahomet</hi> and the doctrine of his Law made for our, adverſaries; yet I can ſcarce imagine that in this great light both of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and profane learning any man in theſe parts of the world would put any ſtreſs upon the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe people, who have not onely a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt enmity to all liberal Sciences and ſuch as are ſutable to the excellence of humane underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but whoſe ſottiſh and abominable ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equals and in ſome things ſurpaſſes that of the Pagans themſelves. 'Tis true, he teaches not onely one ſupreme, but one ſingle and ſolitary Deity, infinite in eſſence and power; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns all thoſe trifling Deities, which rendred the Pagan Religion ſo contemptible. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that this Deity governs the World by his Providence, and that all is ſubject to his Empire, even things natural, fortuitous and contingent, and the motions of the mind of man. He preaches in general that God is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of virtue, and that he will repay wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs with ſutable puniſhments. He extolls the mercy of God, and declares that he invites men to repentance. He exhorts to good works, and aſſerts the reſurrection with a final judgement of all men at the conſummation of the World. But all theſe things which are ſo ſpecious and plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in themſelves, are but as Sugar blended with his poiſonous doctrines to make them be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd more pleaſingly and unadvertedly; nor needs there any long diſcourſe to diſcover his impoſture.</p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:119039:185"/>
               <p>I ſhall not at preſent inſiſt on the qualifications of his perſon, how he was a wretched and vile <hi>Arabian,</hi> and raiſed himſelf to a reputation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by robberies. Nor ſhall I mention his adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and impure concubinage, nor his fraudes and violences. I ſhall paſs over with ſilence, that it was onely the ambition of eſtabliſhing an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire amongſt theeves that induc'd him to invent and hatch that Religion; which he ſuted to the genius of thoſe he was to rule over, who had been accuſtomed to lead diſſolute lives with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to enrich themſelves by depredations and robberies, and to live by violence and rapine. Perhaps ſuch as favour him, may be offended at theſe reproaches, though they contain nothing but what is true. Let the doctrine be conſidered alone in it ſelf. The firſt thing which be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds is that he is a great Prophet of God, and a meſſenger by whoſe miniſtry he makes known his will to men. In the mean while, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the Old and New Teſtament as divine Books; for he affirms that God imparted the Law to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Pſalms to <hi>David,</hi> and the Goſpel to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and in the general ſpeaks very advantageouſly of them all, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as the Goſpel ſucceeded the law, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſucceeds the Goſpel. But how is it poſſible that ſo great a change ſhould arrive in the Church of God, that the Goſpel ſhould be as it were devoured by the Alcoran, without any prediction of ſo remarkable a matter either in the Old or New Teſtament? Certainly God hath followed a quite other method in all times as to what regards the various diſpenſation of his
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:119039:185"/> knowledge. In contracting alliance with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he in a manner laid the foundations of the Law and the Goſpel, and declares things that did foreſhew both the one and the other. The Law which came into the world four hundred years after, made expreſs and direct mention of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf does not deny but that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was promiſed by the Prophets. How comes it to paſs therefore that the Goſpel hath intimated no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Mahomet</hi> to advertiſe the Chriſtians of ſo marveillous a mutation, to the end they might prepare themſelves thereunto? It is true, that his advocates do here alledge two things: One, that <hi>Moſes</hi> deſigned him by thoſe words, <hi>God ſhall raiſe up unto you a Prophet like to me among your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; Hear ye him:</hi> The other, that his name was expreſly written in the Old Teſtament, but that the Jews and Chriſtians have expung'd it out of all places where it was in their books. But both theſe exceptions are vain. For, as for the firſt, The Goſpel applyes thoſe words of <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> Which if they do with juſt reaſon, how are they competent to <hi>Mahomet?</hi> If they be perverted to a contrary ſenſe, whence is it that <hi>Mahomet</hi> confeſſes that the Goſpel is of divine inſtitution and revelation? Either <hi>Mahomet</hi> is an Impoſtor, that arrogates that to himſelf, which agrees to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> or the Goſpel is falſe, to which notwithſtanding <hi>Mahomet</hi> allows the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of being proceeded from the hand of God himſelf. For the ſecond; it is without all colour of reaſon. For who firſt raſed the name of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> out of our Books? Was it done, before he was born, and his doctrine had gain'd any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:119039:186"/> in the world? No, ſurely: for neither the Jews nor the Chriſtians had at that time any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to move them to commit ſuch a ſacriledge. If he were named therein, yet they pretend it was with a promiſe to the Church of God, to raiſe up a great and ſoverain Prophet to it at a certain time; and who would have gone about to efface ſuch promiſes out of the holy books? Certainly, as the Jews did not imbezle out of their Scriptures thoſe which promiſed Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was revealed, ſo neither would the Chriſtians have blotted out of theirs thoſe of this ſupreme Prophet, before he came into the world, And if they have ſo carefully preſerved the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of Antichriſt, who was to commit ſuch horrible outrages, how much more dearly would they have kept the promiſes of this great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable perſonage? Was it then, after the times of <hi>Mahomet?</hi> Certainly, no: for there are copies of the Old and New Teſtament in their primitive language, and <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations made many ages before the birth of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> which are inſerted in the Writings of thoſe that preceded him by a long time, and which are found wholly congruous with ours. The <hi>Chaldaick, Syriack,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Verſions and Paraphraſes which were performed long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe was any mention of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the world, have continued in their integrity to the preſent, without any trace of this prophecy. In a word, of all the ancient Chriſtian and Jewiſh Commentators and Authors that have labored with an incredible diligence in the Old and New Teſtament for a thouſand years paſt, none hath
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:119039:186"/> leſt the leaſt conjecture or ſhadow in his writings of ever having any knowledge of it. Could it poſſibly be, that this prophecy ſhould be ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally rooted out of all the Writings in the World, in which it ought to have been implanted, as not one ſlip or ſprig to be left of it, neither in <hi>Europe,</hi> nor <hi>Aſia,</hi> nor <hi>Africa?</hi> And why were not the Turks carefull to preſerve ſome Authentick Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py wherein it might be found, thereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the fraud of the Chriſtians, and ſupport the honor of their Prophet by the Scriptures? Certainly, we cannot have a greater animoſity againſt <hi>Mahomet,</hi> then the Jews have againſt <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and we are not leſs jealous of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our Goſpel, then they were of their Law. Wherefore ſince they have not eraſed out of their Law the teſtimonies which authoriſe the perſon of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, there is no reaſon to ſuſpect that we ſhould have expunged out of the Goſpel thoſe that had favour'd <hi>Mahomet</hi> and Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <p>But further, put caſe the Holy Spirit forgot to make mention of <hi>Mahomet</hi> as a great Prophet, in the Old and New Teſtament; yet if ſo be the Law, the Prophets, and the Goſpel are proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from God, and the Alcoran alſo be, as its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors pretends, deſcended from Heaven, it is requiſite that their doctrines agree together. For God cannot be repugnant to himſelf. Now the Jews obſerve an excellent correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prophets and the Law; and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians between the Goſpel, the Law, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: but there is ſuch a diſagreement between
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:119039:187"/> theſe Books and the Alcoran, as neither the Mahometans, nor the Jews, nor the Chriſtians, nor God himſelf can reconcile them together. I ſhall not now mention that the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments teach that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is both God and Man, and that there are three Perſons ſubſiſting in the Bleſſed Trinity, and that Chriſt dyed for the redemption of mankind: becauſe they are points, which perhaps may be diſputed: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, to receive the New Teſtament for the Word of God, and to reject the Doctrine of the Trinity, and that of Redemption by the Merit of Chriſt, is as if a man ſhould take back with one hand that which he caſts away with the other. I ſhall onely ſpeak of thoſe things which are clearer then the light it ſelf. In the Alcoran, the Hiſtory of the Creation of the World, of the Tereſtrial Paradiſe, of the Fall of man, of the Death of <hi>Abel,</hi> of the Deluge and the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> of the Angels which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the Selling and Impriſonment of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> of the Plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> of the Calling of <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Miracles, are ſo villanouſly corrupted and contaminated with Fables, both contrary to the truth, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in themſelves, that whatſoever is excellent, elegant, genuine, pathetical and divine in the books of the Jews, becomes cold and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, abſurd and deveſted of all veriſimilitude, when this buſie ſcioliſt ha's the management of it. If <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> were guided by the ſame ſpirit, whence comes it to paſs that they do not agree together? How do the Writings of the Former raviſh attentive and ſober minds
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:119039:187"/> with admiration, while the confuſed traſh of the latter deters ingenuous ſpirits from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of thoſe hiſtories? In like manner, there is in the Evangeliſts a clear and coherent narration of the Annuntiation of the Angel to the Virgin, of the miraculous Conception of Chriſt, of the Birth of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and the hiſtory of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi> his father, of the Crucifying of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and his Aſcenſion into Heaven, and other like matters with their circumſtances and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances. All which is ſo perverſly related in the Alcoran, debaſed with ſo many falſities and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, mangled and diſguiſed with ſo many addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, contradictions and intolerable mutilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that were it not for the proper names that he uſes therein, and ſome ſlight marks by which the reader may judge that he intended the rehearſing of thoſe hiſtories, it would be difficult to imagine that he had ever heard of or underſtood any thing of them. Wherefore, if the Alcoran be proceeded from the Spirit of God, and yet it bears teſtimony to the divinity of the Goſpel, how is it that the ſame ſpirit blows both cold and hot? Why does it report at one time after one manner, and differently at another? Had it loſt the memory of that which paſs'd in <hi>Judaea</hi> five or ſix hundred years before, and therefore recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame afterwards after ſuch a diſagreeing manner? Or why did it not make uſe of the Memorials which the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, who were ocular witneſſes of thoſe tranſactions, had recorded concerning the ſame? But its poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, our Books have been altered. Which is a moſt frivolous exception. For if they were
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:119039:188"/> changed before the Sarazin name was heard in the World, by what prophetick ſpirit could it have been divined that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was to come, and ſo to new mold all the Old and the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, out of deſpight to him? And if it was afterwards, how come our Books to accord from word to word and poynt to poynt, both in this and all other matters, with the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of all them that writ in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity? How would the Jews have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Chriſtians ſo to alter the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the beginning to the end, and the Chriſtians the Jews likewiſe the New, ſeeing they are ſo irreconcileable enemies amongſt themſelves? Is it not rather to be believed, that the ignorance of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who had never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Chriſtianity, and the bad memory of thoſe that help'd him to compile his Alcoran, who ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him by roat, that little of it they had learnt by hear-ſay, cauſed him to committ all thoſe hideous abſurdities? And certainly he extremely miſtruſted that people would believe ſo. For there is nothing he ha's ſo ſtrictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, as to diſpute concerning his Law with the Jews, becauſe his cheats and foiſts are ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to diſcovery and conviction. Two things alone keep up in credit amongſt his fellows the falſities which he vented with ſo outragious an impudence; Force of Arms, the terror of which he diffuſed whereſoever he came, and the Profound Ignorance of the people that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, to whom it is forbidden to enter into any examination of the verity of things.</p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:119039:188"/>
               <p>But if he be fouly inconſiſtent and diſcordant in the relation of hiſtories, he is no leſs in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which he teaches. For the Goſpel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts univerſally to patience, and would not have any maintain or advance it otherwiſe then by ſufferings; and though in other things it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns not wars juſtly engaged in by Princes for conſervation of their rights and the peace of their dominions, yet in matter of Religion it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends onely conſtancy in ſuffering of the Croſs, and would have us be contented with that promiſe, that all ſhall be ſo well ordered by the Providence of God, that none ſhall have cauſe to complain that he leaves his own in oblivion. But what does <hi>Mahomet</hi> in this caſt? There is not a chapter in all his book, wherein he do's not preach fire and ſword, wars and maſſacres for the advancement of his Law. He promiſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in Paradiſe to thoſe that ſhall acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves valiantly therein, and denounces eternal pains to cowards. And although (as He contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf very frequently) he ſays ſometimes that no perſon ought to be conſtrained by force to receive his Law, yet himſelf was the firſt that began ſo to make it be believed, and gave ſpecial commandments for it, which alſo ha's hitherto been practis'd by his ſucceſſors upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In the Goſpel Chriſt reduces Marriage to its ancient and natural purity, prohibiting Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy and Divorce, ſaving in caſe of adultery onely. By the Alcoran it is lawful to have four or five wives, if a man be able to keep them, and to add to them moreover if he pleaſes a number of concubines. How then is it, that Chriſt having
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:119039:189"/> taught that the permiſſion of Divorce was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duligence to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> becauſe of the hardneſs of their hearts, that at the beginning it was not ſo, and ſo having by degrees aboliſh'd polygamies which had been in cuſtom amongſt them; How is it, I ſay, that this Prophet, whoſe revelations are, if you will believe himſelf, the accompliſhment of the Goſpel and the Law, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes the ſame again with ſo boundleſs licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? Certainly Chriſt did in this correct the defects of the polity of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and put things into an eſtate convenient to the excellence of times under the Goſpel. To urge the ſame fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Had there been any thing in the cauſes of the Goſpel to be amended, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ought to have cauſed as much purity of holy marriage to have ſhin'd in his Law above that of Chriſt, as Chriſt had made to appear in his above that of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And notwithſtanding, clean contrary, he diſhonors and pollutes it more then it ever was in the time of the Law of the Jews, or even amongſt idolatrous nations that have had any knowledge of natural honeſty. Add hereunto, that the Goſpel being a Doctrine of holy liberty, and which hath favoured us with the grant of well-uſing ſuch things as are neither good nor evil in themſelves, hath abrogated the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which obliged to abſtain from them, and likewiſe recommended the uſe of them in time of neceſſity: which appears expreſly in wine, which the Apoſtle adviſes <hi>Timothy</hi> to uſe for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſtomach. And ſo far was Chriſt from intending that his diſciples and believers ſhould abhor that ſort of liquor, that he hath made it a
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:119039:189"/> part of the celebration of his moſt ſacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. What new inſpiration therefore had this pretended Prophet to forbid wine as an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing, and the game of Cheſs as a diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical and curſed invention? As for the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Games of Chance, ſuch as Cards and Dice, he is moſt readily commended for it: but I know not what evil ſports of induſtry had done him, that he ſhould attribute the invention of them to wicked ſpirits, and excommunicate unpardonably out of his Paradiſe all thoſe that divert themſelves therewith. Above all things the contrariety of manners and faſhions of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour is remarkable between the authors of theſe two Religions, the Chriſtian and the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan. For Chriſt ſhewed himſelf an unimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of all ſorts of virtues, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> acknowledges him ſuch, and his moſt bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could never find any thing in him that was to be blamed. Whereas <hi>Mahomet,</hi> like a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of uncleanneſs, places amongſt the priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges allowed him above others of his ſect, that it was not lawful for them to have more then four or five wives beſide ſome concubines, but he had liberty from God to eſpouſe as many as he pleas'd. And that which is horrible to hear, he makes God ſpeake as if he had endowed him with extraordinary vigor at his birth for that purpoſe. Yet I am the moſt miſtaken man in the world if he were not jealous; ſo ſtrictly doth he injoyn his wives not to go forth of the houſe, to make no flaunting of their beauty, and never to appear but with a veil over their faces: and ſo ſeverely do's he forbid the Mahometanes to approach
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:119039:190"/> and careſs them, yea to enter into his houſe, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at certain houres prefixed and determined by him. And for the height of continence in a Prophet of God, his ſectators do not deny, that becoming enamour'd of the wife of <hi>Zeid</hi> his ſlave, he caus'd him to divorce her, that he might eſpouſe her himſelf becauſe of her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beauty; and afterwards this beaſt introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces God ſpeaking, and owning that it was he that married them together. Who can doubt, as to the reſt, of the genius of this perſon?</p>
               <p>But indeed the Paradiſe which he promiſes to his True-believers is an indubitable argument that the mind of this man was abſolutely ingulf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the diſſoluteneſs of the fleſh, and ſubverted with the love of women, and that his intention was to inveagle the minds of others by the ſame baits of laſciviouſneſs. For with what beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the heavens above do's he feed their hopes? They ſhall be, ſaies he, in a Paradiſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with fair and delightful fountains, which ſhall flow as gently as if they were of liquid cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal. They ſhall lye and repoſe in the ſhadow, under the cool of thick-leav'd and ſtately trees, which by their own motion ſhall intwine into pleaſing bowers. There ſhall they eat all ſorts of delicious fruits in all ſeaſons, and ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created with the melody of ten thouſand little birds warbling amongſt their branches; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall be mingled the conſort of moſt harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious inſtruments and melodious voices. Their attire ſhall be magnificent and triumphant, as of ſilk purfled with gold, and bedecked with jewels and pearls. They ſhall ſleep in beds imbroider'd
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:119039:190"/> with gold; their pillows ſhall have great pearles hanging at the corners, and their curtaines ſhall be beſet with jewels beyond value and number. And that which tickles his fancy moſt, they ſhall each have their wives tranſcendently beautiful, with breaſts delicately protuberant, and eyes like Jet enchaſed in Sylver, whiter then ſnow, and as great as large Eggs; which is a bigneſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing exorbitant, unles he will give them an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſtature at the Reſurrection. And becauſe <hi>ſine Cerere &amp; Baccho friget Venus,</hi> they ſhall ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet with them every day, and ſhall be diverted with all ſorts of ſports and recreations that can be imagined; and they ſhall be ſerved at their feaſts in fair large goblets of gold and cryſtal, beſet with moſt precious jewels, and that by beautiful young Lads more ſmooth then pearls themſelves, and perfumed with odors beyond that of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-gris and the moſt fragrant of <hi>Arabia.</hi> What can be concluded from this deſcription of his rare Paradiſe, but that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was wholly of fleſh, and there was nothing ſpiritual leſt in his ſoul? Then, as for Hell, he deſcribes it almoſt after the ſame rate. For he ſaies that the Wicked ſhall be cruelly tormented there in flames, and ſhall beg for a little water to refreſh them; upon which ſhall be given a little drop of I know not what liquor, but ſo poiſonous and corroding that it ſhall eat out their bowels, and yet they ſhall not dye; then they ſhall be fed againſt their wills with a fruit reſembling the Devils teſticles, which ſhall boil like fire in their ſtomacks; and they ſhall be cloathed with ſhirts of flaming pitch, and wear great collors of burning fire about their
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:119039:191"/> necks. Is not this an excellent proſpect of the infernal pains? I know there are ſome of ſo perverted fancies as to ſeek out myſterious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines hidden under them. Yea they go ſo far as to make compariſon thereof with that which is contained under the veil of ſome typical and figurative words in the books of the Old and New Teſtament. But were not theſe wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd perſons ſufficiently puniſht in this life by their own folly, they ſhould be anſwered with ſtripes and ſcourges inſtead of the reaſons of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Philoſophers. For what is myſterious in the Bible is ſuch, that were it, not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, yet it offers nothing either abſurd or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. And that which is underſtood of it (as there is ſcarce any thing which is not, ſaving ſome prophecies not yet accompliſhed, in regard they are veiled under enigmatical expreſſions) ha's been manifeſted by events, which are the beſt Commentaries on prophecies, or illuſtrated by doctrines explicitely and cleerly delivered in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of it; So that the whole book does give light unto it ſelf by its own beams. But in thoſe prophecies of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the obſcure mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are irrational and ridiculous in their obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and he that goes about to ſeek ſome doctrine worthy of eſteem under the bark of his words, there is in the firſt place ſuch a perpetual diſſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the text of the Alcoran, that he will ſoon perceive thoſe words were not made for thoſe things; and liken a noble and excellent doctrine cloathed with the ſeemingly myſterious ſtyle of that perſon to the ſtory of <hi>Hercules</hi>'s putting on the attire of a young maid; for what could be
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:119039:191"/> eaſier then to diſcern that thoſe feminine habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were unſutable to the robuſt and nervous members of him that overcame ſo many mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? In the next place he will be forc'd to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that doctrine ſome where elſe, either from the Holy Scripture, or from Philoſophy, and tranſplant the ſame into the Alcoran as into a ſtrange ſoil. For of it ſelf it neither furniſhes matter wherewith to ſupply its deficiency and emptineſs, nor light to clear up its obſcurities. And indeed, what a furious love of the Alcoran is it, that cauſes a man to obſerve ſuch things in it, of which its author would not have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he ever thought, and ſuch as his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters reject, and his followers deteſt and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate? For why are they ſo affected to the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> unleſs becauſe it promiſes them all ſorts of corporeal contentments? And ſhould any expound thoſe things to them in a myſtical way, who doubts but that they would think his endeavor was to cauſe all the hope of their beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to vaniſh into ſmoke?</p>
               <p>Moreover, though for the Words and the Rime, that book was written in an <hi>Arabick</hi> ſtyle good enough, yet it is compoſed of parts ſo looſe and incoherent amongſt themſelves, that 'tis a wonder how they that read it with ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, do not advert its impertinence. For it is a hotchpot of ſeveral confuſed matters huddled together without any other connection then they have by chance; and it is ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that it was built at ſeveral times and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers hands, and not followed according to one uniform and continued deſigne. For he mingles
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:119039:192"/> therein the Hiſtories before the Law with thoſe after it, thoſe of the New Teſtament with the Wars of his own time, and ſometimes divides one into two or three pieces, and contrarily ſometimes ineptly molds two or three into one. Prayers, promiſes, exhortations, admonitions, commandments and laws, priviledges and hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, deſcriptions of Paradiſe and Hell, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Divinity after his manner, fables of times paſt and future, the number of the Celeſtial Orbs, and the death of a Cow are to be found jumbled together in one and the ſame Chapter. And you would ſay ſometimes that they are verily the ravings of a man in a fever, or the enthuſiaſmes of a drunkard.

                  </q> And if the order thereof be ſo perverted, the matter is little better. He ſaies that the Mind of man is a portion of the ſoul of God, which he breath'd into him at his firſt creation, and that under the ſhadow which the trees make they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Deity. He ſwears by the Alcoran in one place, and in another by his pen, that that book was ſent to him from Heaven. That the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens would fall, were it not for the Angels that pray for us. That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had the ſoul of God. That many deſerted Chriſt, becauſe he was too eloquent. And diſputing againſt the Chriſtians he proves that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is not the Son of God, and that God can have no Son, in as much as he hath no need of any thing whatſoever.
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:119039:192"/> He ſaies, Men were created of ſhadow, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels of flames of fire. And as for the creation of the reſt of the Univerſe, he relates it in this manner: God created the Earth in two days, and faſtned it, to the mountains as it were by anchors and cables. In the two next dayes he cauſed all ſorts of herbs to ſpring up for the nutriment of animals. After which the earth being thus framed began to emit exhalations and ſteams, of which he formed the Heavens in two other days, in which he placed the Stars, and gave them principally in charge to chaſe away the Devils by the ſplendor of their light when they go to ſpy what is doing in Heaven. Did he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or rage, when he writ all theſe excellent pieces of Divinity? But then he interweaves the ſame here and there with I know not what putid fables. He repeates a hundred and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, ſo diſtruſtful is he it will not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that God is the author of that rare book, &amp; profeſſes that all mankind together could not have made the leaſt ſyllable of it. He ſprinkles the doctrine of the reſurrection with ſhamefull and unprofitable fables. Sometimes he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to diſcourſe of matters treated on by the Writers of the New Teſtament, and preſently diſcovers that he underſtands nothing at all of them; as where he makes a compariſon of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with <hi>Adam.</hi> Then in another place he trifles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruouſly about the Table of the Lord and the Sacraments of the Goſpel. He boaſts of having cemented the Moon together again which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had cut in ſunder. He ſpeaks of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Providence of God, as a Fatal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny;
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:119039:193"/> and ſome ſay, 'tis by this means that he rendred his followers ſo adventurous in war, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being perſwaded that the decrees of that Deſtiny are inevitable, they caſt themſelves without heed into the mouth of danger, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming they ſhall not dye, in caſe it be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated, though their hearts were pierced with a hundred Javelins. Laſtly, he contradicts himſelf at every turn. But the thing for which he moſt frequently defends himſelf, is his not doing of miracles, and he will not allow anyone to require them from him; though indeed he did all thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which no man ought to undertake unleſs he can prove his vocation by authentick miracles. For he aboliſht the conſtitutions which himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged were authoris'd by God, as thoſe of the Law and the Goſpel. He introduc'd a new form of Religion, and invaded the dignity of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Magiſtrates, levying armes againſt Princes, though he was but a private perſon, giving liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſlaves in ſpight of their maſters with an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute authority, and maikng invaſions and wars the moſt violent and bloody that ever were ſeen in the world, But ought not he to have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris'd himſelf by miracles, to ſhew the right he had to do all this? Who ever attempted any of thoſe things, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Elias,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his Apoſtles, but at ſometime or other gave teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their celeſtial calling by miracles? Certainly when I conſider on the one ſide the abſurdity and groſſeneſs of almoſt every thing he ſaies, I cannot but think he had great need of miracles to perſwade the ſame to people of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and I ſhould reckon it a miracle if
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:119039:193"/> any honeſt man could believe him. And on the other ſide when I conſider the nature of his doctrine, and thoſe to whom he perſwaded it, I conceive it no great miracle to have allur'd and drawn carnal minds by the gaudy baits of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Paradiſe. In a word, it needs not to be much verſed in that work to obſerve that it is a medly of all impertinent and bad things, amongſt which there is ſometimes found ſome little good, as there is in the Drugs of Egypt.</p>

               <p>But what good there is there, is overwhelmed in an abyſſe of falſities, impieties, fables and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences; and it is not difficult to ſhew from what fountains he deriv'd it all.

The greateſt part of his Fables are borrowed from the Jews and ſome Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Authors that were current, like falſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, in thoſe times: and his groſs follies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:119039:194"/> he hath larded and ſtrewed it throughout, came from his own ignorance, and for that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf no knowledge at all neither of the Old nor New Teſtament nor of the writings of the Jews nor profane hiſtories nor the Poets, he truſted to the memory of a lewd Monk, and ſome falſe Chriſtians or falſe Jews, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtood very much of them; whence all that he relates out of them is delivered raſhly and at random. But on the other ſide, though there were nothing but truth in the whole Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, nothing but what were rational in it ſelf and conſentaneous to the Holy Scriptures, both for hiſtories and doctrines, yet the author of it ought nevertheleſs to be held for no other then an Impoſtor, for that he dares to vaunt himſelf for a great Prophet. For ſuch a Prophet as he pretends to be, ought not onely to declare things agreeing with thoſe that were before him, but either to reveal doctrines unknown till then, or to expound thoſe which were delivered enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically, and to unveil them out of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities, and withall to make faith of his calling either by miracles or propheſies of things to come ratified by the events, the prediction of which does not import the vivacity of humane wit by penetrating by conjectures into ſome things undiſcern'd by vulgar eyes, but the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God to whom the bottom of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable ſecrets is conſpicuous. Otherwiſe all Divines that ever writ concerning Religion either Jewiſh or Chriſtian congruouſly to the books of the Old and New Teſtament, ſhould be either Prophets or Apoſtles. Beſides, were there
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:119039:194"/> no errors in the Alcoran, yet how many books have we that treat the beſt things contained therein in a manner incomparably more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Wherefore he ought to be accounted a Deceiver, and the father of Deceivers, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ignorant, ſo impertinent, ſo abſurd, ſo diſcordant from truth, ſo fabulous and pollute, he yet glories that he is the greateſt of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, by whoſe miniſtry God revealed himſelf to men.</p>
               <p>Now if <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf was ſo groſs and mad a fool, his principal Doctors and interpreters had yet more need of manacles and chaines then he; which I ſhall ſhew onely by the ſample of two books which they have in eſteem. In one of which is deſcribed the journey of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> into Paradiſe by the conduct of the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi> He entred (ſay they) into the firſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, being mounted upon <hi>Alborach,</hi> an animal ſomething bigger then an Aſſe, and having a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane face; where he obſerv'd that that firſt ſphere was of fine ſilver, and ſo thick as would require the ſpace of five hundred years to be travell'd over by a foot-man. There they found an Angel ſo high as it would be a thouſand years journey from his head to his foot, with ſeventy thouſand other Angels, each of which had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty thouſand heads, every head ſeventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hornes, every horn ſeventy thouſand knots, and the diſtance of fourty years journey between one knot and another. Alſo, every head had ſeventy thouſand faces, in every of which there were ſeventy thouſand mouths, in every mouth ſeventy thouſand tongues, and every
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:119039:195"/> tongue ſpoke a thouſand languages, in which they praiſed God ſeventy thouſand times a day: you may imagine what a rare melodious noiſe they made. In the ſecond heaven, which is made all of burniſhed gold, they found a great multitude of Angels greater then the former, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom there was one whoſe ſeet touch'd the earth and his head the eighth Heaven. 'Tis ſtrange no body ever ſaw him at leaſt in one of the hemiſpheres. But all theſe were but pygmies in compariſon of another, whom they met in the third Heaven, who was ſo prodigiouſly great that if he ſhould hold all the world in the palm of his hand, he could nevertheleſs ſhut it. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and thoſe which were in the fourth heaven, it is hard to ſay whether there were any proportion, unleſs ſome new Geometry be f und out to expreſs it. For every one of them had ſeventy pair of wings, in each of which were ſeventy thouſand pinions, and every pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſeventy thouſand cubits long. But as for him that they ſaw in the fifth ſphere, the Poets with their <hi>Briareus</hi> never underſtood any thing of him; for what was he with his hundred armes to the Angel that opened the gate to them, who had ſeven thouſand arms, at the end of each of which he moved ſeventy thouſand hands? In the other ſpheres they ſcarce found Angels of ſo enormous a ſtature: but in the eighth ſphere they beheld I cannot tell what huge Gyant, ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that he could have ſwollowed the Globe of the Earth &amp; Sea as eaſily as a little Pill. Is the true Hiſtory of <hi>Lucian</hi> and the Chronicles of <hi>Garagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> to be compared to this? In the other Book is
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:119039:195"/> recited the diſcourſe between a Muſulman and a Jew who puts queſtions to him about the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal points of his doctrine; and here it is that the ſpirit of error and lying diſplayes its full ſails. He ſaies God created a large Carton or Paper-vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume and a pen of ſo rare a ſhape, that it was five hundred days journey in length and four and twenty in breadth; and that with this pen, which ha's four and twenty points, he writes continually in that Paper all that ever was, is, or ſhall be in the world. That the light of the Sun and the Moon were equal in the beginning, ſo that the day could not be well diſtinguiſh'd from the night, but the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> as he flew by, ſtruck the Moon with the end of his wing and made it looſe half its light. Mention is made there of an Ox, of ſo immenſe a greatneſs, that between each of his horns (whereof he hath fourty) there is the diſtance of a thouſand years journey. And yet he ſays this Ox is under the Earth, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſail round about in leſs then a year. And leaſt the Sea ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of being deſtitute of Mahometical Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, he aſſignes a fiſh to it, whoſe head is in the Eaſt, and tail in the Weſt, which carries on his back the whole earth, ſeas, and mountains; a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy load indeed; but the air and darkneſs which he caſts into his burden do not much increaſe his weight. He makes Rats to have been produc'd in the Ark of the ſneeſing of a Hog, and Cats of the ſneeſing of a Lyon, perhaps by reaſon of the reſemblance of their ſnout and muzzle. And he ſaies that <hi>Seraphiel</hi> (whoſoever he be, is not worth much enquiry) on the day of reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:119039:196"/> ſhall by ſounding a trumpet of five hundred years journey long, puffe out all the ſouls of the deceaſed, which being ſo diſperſed about the world ſhall fly about, every one ſeeking its own body. They that find allegorical ſenſes in theſe rare texts, I think no reaſonable man will judge but a portion of Hellebore were more fit for them then argumentative diſcourſes. Wherefore let him be perpetually concluded and accounted a moſt ſtupid and ſenſeleſſe perſon, who will not ſubſcribe to this Reſult, that the doctrine of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> is ſo far from being of divine revelation, that it is not ſo much as of humane inſtitution. Or if man had any ſhare in it, the evil ſpirit, when he contriv'd it, was lodged in his hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres.</p>

               <p>I Intimated above that the Jewiſh Religion is not to be diſtinguiſhed according to the Sects of thoſe that profeſs it, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the times in which they liv'd. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in this conteſt againſt thoſe that maintain Indifference in the external profeſſion of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, it is not material, if they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Jewiſh, in what time they conſider it, before or after the birth of Chriſt. For if they plead it as it was eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Moſes</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued down to the birth of Chriſt, there never was any that ſo ſeverely forbad its profeſſors to participate in ſtrange ceremonies. The firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of their Law is, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods before me.</hi> And next, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf the likeneſs of any that is in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath, or in the Waters under the earth; Thou ſhalt not bow down before it.</hi> Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in one and the ſame prohibition both devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards other Gods, and the expreſſion of it towards their Images. And all the books of <hi>Moſes</hi> are in a manner but a commentary in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation<pb n="368" facs="tcp:119039:197"/> of theſe two Commandments, repeated and inculcated from page to page. As likewiſe all the ceremonies enjoyned by the ſame Law, differing from thoſe of all the Gentiles, were as a ſeparation between thoſe Nations, which withheld the Gentiles from approaching to the Jews, whoſe God they did not know, and the Jews ftom communicating with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, whom they looked upon as profane and idolatrous. Marriages with the Daughters of ſtrangers were forbidden them, leaſt they ſhould become ſnares to them and cauſe them to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to other Gods: and the total extirpation of the inhabitants of <hi>Canaan</hi> was commanded, to the end there might remain no memory of them or their idols, which might be an occaſion of perverſion and ſcandal to them. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by many experiences that God and men conſtrued this Law after this manner. For there is no where elſe to be found examples of greater reſolution and conſtancy in maintaing of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They have choſen rather to be caſt into burning furnaces, and amongſt the paws of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then to conform to the idolatries of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> They have endured cruel deaths rather then they would taſte of ſwins fleſh, which was forbidden to them, and in ſhort, have cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuffered all kinds of oppreſſions and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences for the deſenſe of their Law. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide we do not finde more dreadful judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted on any nation for aſſociating with other people in their religious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. For they have been inſlaved by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, their Country turn'd into deſolation,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:119039:197"/> and their whole Nation carried away by their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious enemies into a ſtrange Land. And indeed the caſe is too notorious of it ſelf to be doubted. If the Jewiſh Religion be conſidered as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by them at this day, being themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it to be of a permanent durance, and not ſubject to any variation, it follows that they muſt accord in this point with the doctrine of their anceſtors. For wherefore ſhould it be changed in this particular, being in all others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable? And truly their practiſe is not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of old. They bear ſtill about them a token imprinted in their fleſh, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates them from the reſt of mankind. They abhor and deſpiſe other nations as ignorant of the true God: and abominate Images and Statues more in theſe days then ever, as reminding them of the idolatry heretofore ſo expreſly forbidden to their fathers. So that they chooſe rather to be the ſcorn and hatred of all Nations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all hopes of honors, pre-eminences, great poſſeſſions, and offices, which are ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful attractives to the reſt of mankind, then to conform onely in outward profeſſion to our devotions, and ſet foot in our Churches. But if they were of the Opinion of our Indifferents, were it not an eaſie thing for them to be baptis'd, and thereby redeem themſelves from ſo many miſchiefs, and partake in the honours of the Countries in which they dwell? It is true, ſome Marchands amongſt them diſſemble in ſuch places where they are not permitted to ſojourn; but they do it with great regret and againſt their conſciences. Yet they cannot be brought to do
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:119039:198"/> any thing on the Saturday for fear of violating the Sabbath, or to eat the fleſh of ſwine, the prohibition whereof they account perpetually valid.</p>
               <p>But ſhould the preſent Jews have degenerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this particular, as they have done in many others, from the faith and practiſe of their anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, yet there ought not any account to be made of their teſtimony as to the matter in queſtion. For whatever advantages they have above the Pagans and Mahometans, they are nevertheleſs deviated from the way of ſalvation as well as they, and cannot pretend hereafter to have that Divine Revelation which ought to be the ſole Rule to men of piety and devotion. Indeed their race is the nobleſt of all others; and there is no King or people that can boaſt to be deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſo ancient a ſtock, nor prove their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree by ſo authentick evidences. For they are not guilty of the ridiculous vanity of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> who by their own account are many thouſand years elder then the World; nor of that of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who thought themſelves ſprung out of their own ſoil. They do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have been formed of the Stones of <hi>Pyrrha,</hi> nor go about to rake the badges of their nobility out of the rubbidge of <hi>Troy.</hi> They ſhew by a great ſeries of time, and an exact &amp; clear diſplay of divers periods the world of, that their firſt father was the common father of all, and that no nation can have any manifeſtation of its original but from their Records. As for the Antiquity of their Religion, it preceded all others by many Ages. It ha's been ratified by an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:119039:198"/> of great and excellent miracles, which made that Nation ſometimes formidable to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and which being frequently exploited, did without queſtion advance it above the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel of all other people of the Earth. It ha's preſerved amongſt them the knowledge of the true God, and delivered the ſame to us, diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated from the confuſion of ſo many falſe Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to whom our Anceſtors were devoted. It gave them to know after what manner the World was at firſt formed, and ha's preſerved freſh amongſt them the memory of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable matters that arrived in that primitive Age of Men, of which other nations have had onely ſome kind of obſcure and faint glimpſes in fabulous ſtories, which afford onely enough e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to convince the books of the Pagans of vanity, and to confirm the truth of what is found in the Jewiſh hiſtories. And that which advantages them yet more, is, that their Law contains ſuch an excellent model of all piety and virtue, that more wiſdom ha's been revealed to them in ten words onely, then can be collected out of the Books of all the Philoſophers, were the quinteſſence extracted out of them. In a Word, the Books of their Law and the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Prophets are proceeded from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and as it ſhall more amply appear, they bear with them moſt undeniable teſtimonies of it. But the polity of their Religion, how divine ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was to be changed; and its time being expired, we muſt otherwhere ſeek the rules of that which we ought to follow.</p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:119039:199"/>
               <p>Wherefore to ſhew that their Law was to be changed, and that it was eſtabliſht but for a time, it muſt be conſider'd in each of its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal parts; As in the Political Laws, upon which their Republick was founded; In their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Ordinances, in obſervation whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted all their external divine ſervice; And in the Ten Commandments of the Two Tables, which contain the General Precepts of piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and virtue which ought to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd amongſt men. As for their Political Laws, they were excellent indeed for the government of that Nation, and eſtabliſh'd with ſingular Wiſdom. But I conceive there is no Jew ſo opinative, as to account them proper for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of all ſorts of Nations in all Ages. For every country, every people, and time muſt have its reſpective laws, and there is neceſſity of altering the ſame according to the variety of circumſtances. And as Divorce was permitted in the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in its political go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for ſome neceſſity particular to that Nation, ſo there may be ſome other Nations, in which likewiſe for ſome political neceſſity it muſt be abſolutely forbidden. It would ſeem unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in a country where the houſes are built with plain ridges, for the publick authority to demoliſh all ſort of edifices of that faſhion, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join to build only with battlements and balliſters. Now it is as little comprehenſible, how in ſuch a Country as <hi>France</hi> is, the Laws given by <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the determination of Law-ſuits could be practis'd. It would be requiſite not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to change the order of Magiſtrates and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:119039:199"/> of Courts, but to new mold the manners of the intire Nation. And how could the divers forms of Governments of Kingdoms and Empires be conformed to the political Law of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as Monarchy in <hi>France,</hi> Ariſtocracy in <hi>Venice,</hi> and Democracy in <hi>Athens?</hi> Muſt they that ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Jews in theſe parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> renounce all ſoverain powers that are ſo well eſtabliſh'd therein according to the genius of every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to reform them all according to the model of the Jewiſh policy? And if the great Cham of the <hi>Tartars</hi> with all his ſubjects, ſhould cauſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be circumciſed, to what purpoſe would the Laws of Tenths for the <hi>Levites,</hi> &amp; the like, be in his Country? Indeed all the policy of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was regulated either according to the nature of that people, different from moſt others, or according to the diviſion of their Tribes, wherewith other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had no reſemblance, or elſe according to the quality of the Country, which was unlike to others in many reſpects. But on the other ſide, their great Legiſlator, the moſt pious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their Kings, and the divineſt amongſt their Prophets have expreſly promis'd the Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Nations to the communion of one and the ſame Law with the Jews, ſo that they ſhall make up but one people. <hi>Rejoyce O ye Nations, his people,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 32.43. And <hi>David</hi> in the 117. <hi>Pſalm, O praiſe the Lord, all ye Nations; praiſe him all ye people.</hi> Why? but for being called to his knowledge. And in <hi>Pſal</hi> 69.1. <hi>O ſing unto the Lord a new ſong: All the Earth ſing unto the Lord,</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>Declare his glory among the heathen, and his Wonders among all people.</hi> But <hi>Iſaiah</hi> more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:119039:200"/> when he promiſes in the 55. <hi>chap.</hi> of his Revelations, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhall be equally a Legiſlator of the Jews and others, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Behold, I have given him for a witneſs to the Nations, to be a leader and commander of the people. Behold, thou ſhalt call a Nation that thou kneweſt not; and the Nations which knew not thee ſhall run unto thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Lord thy God.</hi> And 'tis for the ſame reaſon that he ſpeaks thus to the Church of God in the foregoing Chapter, <hi>Sing, O barren, thou that didſt not bear; break forth into ſinging and cry aloud, thou that knoweſt not what it is to travel with child,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them ſtretch forth the curtaines of thy Pavillions; ſpare not, lengthen thy cord and ſtrengthen thy ſtakes. For thou ſhalt ſpread forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy poſterity ſhall inherit the Nations, and make the deſolate Cities to be inhabited.</hi> And the Jews themſelves await the accompliſhment of theſe promiſes. Wherefore it follows neceſſarily that their Law, as to the policy of the Commonwealth, was to alter; and that whereas before, it oblig'd all thoſe who had any intereſt and title in the Alliance which God had contracted with them, the uſe thereof in this reſpect is now become free, and not neceſſarily obligatory. The truth is, though political Laws of Republicks be nothing but the natural laws of juſtice and honeſty, which being general are applyed to particular matters according to the diverſity of circumſtances, which are infinite and infinitely variable; provided that in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of every Nation the image of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural juſtice be always reſplendent in their Laws, it is not important whether there be difference
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:119039:200"/> in things of leſſer concernment. And it would be too rigorous a yoak, to ſubject all Nations to the ſame form of Laws, without regard whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the humors of men and conditions of times permit it. Now whereas the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is compoſed of three parts equally, the change of one neceſſarily infers with it the alteration of the reſt. And it muſt needs fall out here as it do's in the building of Palaces. For he that ſhould go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to change one part of a great uniform edifice it would be needful for him to change it all, and ruine it all from top to bottom; otherwiſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity of its parts would render it unproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and deformed.</p>
               <p>But this is more manifeſt in the Ceremonial Law, in which conſiſted all external ſervice performed to God. For it would be more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for all Nations to obey that, then the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical. What likelihood is there, I beſeech you, that God would tye all Nations, ſo remote and diſpers'd upon the face of the Earth, to repair and ſacrifice at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and aſſemble there at ſolemn Feaſts? That from the North, South, Eaſt and Weſt, they ſhould all be there at a time appointed to perform that ſervice, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the interval ſo many Seas &amp; mountains: And if when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was beſieged by <hi>Titus,</hi> the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men grievouſly peſtred the place, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there was onely the Nation of the Jews aſſembled there at that time, what <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> would be capable of containing all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beſides, which ought to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God? Could the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> have furniſhed Sacrificers enough, or <hi>Judea</hi>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:119039:201"/> beaſts for victimes? Could the Temple, had it been twenty times as big as that which <hi>Herod</hi> built, have received the twentieth part of thoſe that were to perform their devotions in it? And what a horrible ſlaughter would there be, or how could they eſcape the deluge of blood which would fill the ſtreets if every one were to offer his beaſt? But indeed he that ſhall duely conſider the whole ſtructure of the Religious Policy which was ſometimes amongſt them, ſhall find that it ha's not the appearance of a thing that was to indure to perpetuity, but was onely the platform and delineation of ſome other to come in its place. For to what end ſerv'd the maſſacre of ſo many beaſts? Was it, becauſe God took pleaſure in the fleſh of bulls, or in the blood of Goats? Himſelf denies it in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. In the 50. <hi>Pſalm</hi> verſ. 8. <hi>I will not reprove thee for thy Sacrifices, or for the burnt-offerings which ſhould be continually before me. I will take no bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock out of thy houſe, nor he-goats out of thy folds,</hi> &amp;c. Verſ. 13. <hi>Will I eat the fleſh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer unto God thankſgiving,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo, <hi>Thou takeſt no pleaſure in ſacrifices, elſe would I give them; the burnt-offering is not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to thee. The ſacrifices of God are a contrite ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in a ſeverer ſtrain, <hi>chap.</hi> 66. <hi>He that killeth an Ox is as if he ſlew a man; he that ſacrificeth a ſheep, as if he cut off a dogs neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered the blood of a ſwine; he that burneth incenſe, as if he bleſſed an Idol.</hi> And certainly he ſhould have too low an opinion of God, that ſhould imagine he deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in beholding the ſpilling of the blood, or
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:119039:201"/> the ſmoking of the fat of ſacrifices. He takes pleaſure in the piety of the heart and in virtue, and not in the odor of incenſe or the death of beaſts. Was it to make propitiation for their ſins, and ſecure them from the curſe denounced by their Law? Much leſs. For 'tis poſſible ſome man might fancy God ſo good towards his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as to be pleas'd with ſuch offerings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a good heart, as teſtimonies of its devotion; But he is too juſt for any to imagine, that when he is incenſed he maybe ſatisfied with trifles. Laſtly, was it to exerciſe the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and keep them in diſcipline, as curbes and paſternes are us'd to unruly horſes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers rules of diſcipline are preſcribed to youth inclinable to deboſhery? This indeed was one of the uſes of the Law, but the Jews will not acknowledge it, and which they cannot have learnt but from the Doctors and Founders of the Chriſtian Church. Moreover, theſe exerciſes are not to be continued for ever: We take away the ſhackels from horſes when they are become tractable, and leave children to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct when they come to age. Can it be thought then, that the Church of God ſhould be alwaies in infancy, and never come to perfect age to have no more need of ſo exact and ſo rigorous a diſcipline? Let them conſult their Books well, and they will find that in proceſs of time God gave them to underſtand that all thoſe things were but ſhadows, which were to vaniſh when the truth ſhould be manifeſted, and that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably as that time approacht, the contempt that he had of thoſe things in themſelves was
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:119039:202"/> diſcover'd. For in the books of <hi>Moſes</hi> they are moſt ſeverely enjoyned as if the ſervice of God really conſiſted therein. In the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> God begins to decry the uſe of them. And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the firſt and the ſixty ſixt Chapter of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, ſpeaks ſo diſadvantageouſly of them, that he almoſt as good as ſaies that they were even already aboliſht. I know well, that he ſpeaks of them after a comparative manner with internal vertues, which the Jews wholly forgot, confining themſelves ſtrictly and truſting in the obſervation of theſe externals. But I conceive that <hi>Moſes</hi> in reproving the contempt of internal piety, would never have ſpoken with ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain of thoſe corporeal ſacrifices, and there is nothing in all his books but gives aſſurance of the contrary. Whence then ſhould this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them ariſe, ſince they were all guided by the ſame ſpirit, but that <hi>Moſes</hi> was yet too remote from the body in which thoſe ſhadows were to terminate? To what end were their Arks, Propitiatories, or Mercy-ſeats, Tables of Shew-bread, candleſticks, diſhes, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, courtains, covertures, veiles, altars, ſives, gridirons, cenſers, and lamps, in a word all the accoutrements and deckings of the Tabernacle, which if they repreſented nothing but what they barely ſeem, would be frivolous and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? Eſpecially, why ſhould God ſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give the whole ſcheme of it, and injoyn <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſo ſtrictly not to tranſgreſs in any thing from the pattern ſhewn to him in the mountain? Certainly if all this had no further reference then to the Tabernacle, no body can give a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:119039:202"/> reaſon why God ſhould make ſo ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a deſcription of it, or why he ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part extraordinary graces of his ſpirit to the chief managers of the whole work, unleſs we will ſay that God takes pleaſure, like us, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodery and painting. But when he ſaies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly that it was onely a repreſentation of what he had ſhewn to <hi>Moſes,</hi> he apparently intimates that he aimed further, and that the Tabernacle was but the image of that which God reſerved to himſelf till another time, and the Iſraelites were to expect. For ſeeing our minds are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contented with the images of things, when-they conſider that they are meerly images, be; cauſe they cannot perfectly repreſent the life and the more exquiſitely the images ſeem to be made, the more deſirous are we to ſee the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; God admoniſhing them that the Ark and the Tabernacle were but repreſentations of that which he kept hid with him, would by degrees excite them in the deſire to behold the thing it ſelf. But he would never have excited the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of men for nothing: if he inflame our hearts with any deſires, he alwayes ſupplies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſatiate them, and never deludes men with vain expectations. Wherefore it muſt needs be that he ha's exhibited the ſame in it's due time, and the figure ha's given place to the ſubſtance. For at the appearance of the body it would be a folly afterwards to ſtick to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ſhadows. God therfore ha's done like an excellent Architect who intending to build a great and magnificent Palace, before he cuts out the porphyry, prepares the pillars, forms the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:119039:203"/> arches, carves and ſquares the pieces of Cedar for the feeling or the Wainſcot, deſignes out his whole work with a Crayon on paper, and takes pleaſure in beholding the proportions of it in ſuch an Idea. For before building up his Church of all Nations, and revealing his ſpiritual ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to it, he was pleaſed firſt to behold the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it in the ſtructure of the Tabernacle, and in the whole Legal Polity of the Jewiſh Church. Not to make an aſſay, or take his proportions, for fear of failing when he ſhould come to the effect; for all his works are preſent before him from eternity, but becauſe the time did not yet require that he ſhould put his hand to the true building, he would as it were pleaſe himſelf in the Idea which he had pourtraied of it in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews, and give thoſe that ſhould one day ſee the real extribition of the thing it ſelf, ſingular incitements to admire his wiſdom in the wonderful correſpondence of the building with the ſhadow.</p>
               <p>Now in my judgement the preſent Jews ought to reflect more ſeriouſly upon the ſtate of their affairs, and the change which is really and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently befallen them; which if they did, they muſt be very obſtinate not to be convinced by ſuch experience. God cauſed the tabernacle to be built in the deſart, and placed his Ark in it, giving them to know thereby that he dwelt with them under tents, during their attending the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his promiſes. Afterwards he permitted a Temple to be built to him in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> wherein the Ark was at length ſetled, which till then had been ambulatory. As if he
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:119039:203"/> would ſignifie that his abode was fixed among them, and their Nation abſolutely confirm'd in the promiſed land. And who would not have ſaid at that time, that the Temple would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as firme as the mountain it ſelf on which it ſtood, <hi>David</hi> having utterly defeated his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and filled all the neighbouring countries about him with the terror of his armes, and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> injoying ſo profound a peace? Nevertheleſs, about four hundred &amp; fifty years after, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is ruin'd, the Temple ras'd to the ground, and all the ſacred veſſels carried away to <hi>Babylon;</hi> and as for the Ark, it was never ſeen after in the World. Behold a notable change befallen both to their Civil and Religious Polity. For they had no longer a King, which was the head of the Republick, nor the Ark, which was incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the moſt venerable part of all their Religious Myſteries. Yet this was but the fore-runner of a more univerſal change. The diſtinction of their Tribes remained ſtill, and the Royal race was owned in that of <hi>Judah,</hi> and that of <hi>Levi</hi> was preſerved for the reſtoring of their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. 'Tis likewiſe true, that at the end of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years they return'd from their captivity, and rebuilt the Temple, but much leſs then that before, inferior to it in all prerogatives, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in being deſtitute of that particular teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the preſence of God which was before in the Mercy-ſeat. Why was it thus, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the time was drawing nigh, in which they ſhould ſeek their God no more upon the Earth, and that conſequently their Religious polity ſhould be ended, ſeeing it had this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:119039:204"/> promiſe, <hi>I will dwell in the midſt of them, and abide there;</hi> which is not to be underſtood but of the Tabernacle and the Ark, At length, after many profanations, the ſecond Temple is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed from the foundations, the City of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> burnt to aſhes, the Nation diſpers'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Levites, without ſacrificers, without ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without offerings, without ſolemn Feaſts Sabbaths, Altars, Incenſe and Lampes, and this for the ſpace of fifteen or ſixteen hundred years, without any hopes of ever being recollected from ſo dreadful a diſſipation. And which is more, all their Tribes ſo confounded by their long wandrings and by the ſearch that ha's been made for all the evidences of their Genealogies to aboliſh them, that they know no longer to diſtinguiſh which is <hi>Judah,</hi> or which is <hi>Levi,</hi> or <hi>Benjamine,</hi> or any other Line. Certainly if that diſpenſation was to have been perpetual, God would never have permitted ſo long an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of it, much leſs ſuch as it ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be redreſs'd. For ſhould they rebuild <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet the Function of Sacrificing hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been reſtrain'd to the Family of <hi>Levi</hi> with excluſion of the reſt, they could not have any lawful Sacrificers, by reaſon of the confuſion of their Tribes.</p>
               <p>Let us now proceed to the Law of ten Words (or Decalogue) contained in the two Tables. In which two things are conſiderable. Firſt, that it is, as was ſaid above, a perfect model of piety and virtue, and in a manner the image of God himſelf. Secondly, that God propounded the hopes of life to the Jews upon obſervation of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:119039:204"/> this Law together with the Judicial and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial; and forbad the tranſgreſſion of it with threatnings of an unevitable curſe. For theſe are the termes, <hi>Do this and thou ſhalt live;</hi> and, <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all the words of this Law to do them.</hi> Now, as for the firſt of theſe things, no perſon can deny to the Jews, but it is of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duration, and ought to be uniformely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd amongſt all Nations. For ſince God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable in his own nature, his image alſo muſt of neceſſity be alike invariable; and I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready aſſerted that his image conſiſts in the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and juſtice of this Law. But as for the other, there muſt neceſſarily betide a change in that as well as in the other Laws. For though God ha's inſtituted Religion to ſave men and not to be as a ſnare to make them obnoxious to eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, how could this law be the means of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſalvation, which no man (except one onley) ever perfectly obſerved in all ages, yea which no man can obſerve in any age? Not that his Commandments are impoſſible to be performed in themſelves, if we were not fallen from our ancient and primitive Integrity. For what is there more proportionate to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculties, if they were in their integrity, then to love God with all our heart, and our neighbor as our ſelves? But for that ſin ha's caus'd ſuch a diſorder in us, and imbued us with ſo profound habits of vices, it is always impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for our affections to be duely conformed to that obedience. Since therefore, according to the Religion of the Jews the hope of ſalvation is ſolely in the abſolute obſervation of this Law,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:119039:205"/> and on the other ſide the violation of it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an evitable curſe, conſcience, which checks all men for ſin, ſuggeſts to them, that either there muſt be ſome change in Religion as to this regard to become capable of ſalvation, or that Religion was inſtituted not out of a deſigne to ſave but to curſe and deſtroy. They will ſay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that there are promiſes of mercy mingled here and there in this Law, for thoſe that ſhall repent of their ſins, whereof their conſcience convinces them. And I grant it. Miſerable had they been, if it had not been ſo. For how could they have appeaſed the diſquiets of their conſcience? But I ſay the promiſes of mercy to penitents do not belong to the Contract eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſh'd between God and them, according to which he promiſed life to thoſe that kept it, and denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a curſe to thoſe that ſhould tranſgreſs it in the leaſt clauſe. For how can one and the ſame Covenant be capable of two ſuch contrary clauſes, Curſed is whoſoever ſhall not obſerve this Law in all points; and, Mercy it promiſed to thoſe that repent of the tranſgreſſions which they commit. What is repenting but returning to be a good man? And what is to be a good man, but to obſerve this Law? Therefore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is an obſerving the Law after a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, I ſay an obſerving it, inaſmuch as the Repentance be good and durable. Whence theſe two propoſitions will be found contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in one and the ſame Contract, Curſed is whoſoever abideth not in all the things of this Law to do them; and, Whoſoever does not abide in all things of this Law, is not therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:119039:205"/> provided he does not alwayes perſevere in his tranſgreſſion, but at length repent of it. Now it is not conſentaneous to the Wiſdom of God to contract an alliance of ſo repugnant parts. But further, There will not be onely a contradiction in the denouncing of the Curſe but alſo in the promiſe of reward. For obſerve how the Law ſpeaks; <hi>Do theſe things and thou ſhalt live,</hi> that is, Obſerve this Law in all points, and thou ſhalt have life for thy ſalary of obſerving it. So that he that obtains Life by the Law, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it by virtue of his obſervation thereof, as a recompenſe. Now Life and the Curſe are ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd that he that ha's not life falls into the curſe, and on the contrary he that is delivered from the curſe is inſtated in the injoyment of life. As he that is in health or in the light, is thereby exempt from diſeaſes and darkneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily he that is ſick or in darkneſs is neceſſarily depriv'd of health and light; The injoyment or ſenſe of the one conſiſting in the privation of the other. If therefore the ſame Law ſays, Repent and thou ſhalt obtain mercy, ſeeing mercy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes deliverance from the Curſe deſerved, and deliverance from the curſe is nothing but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of life, it will follow that by the ſame contract life will be obtain'd as a recompenſe of the obſervation of the Law, and nevertheleſs be a favour too in regard of mercy. Which are things directly repugnant, and cannot be reconcil'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Theſe promiſes therefore belong to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Covenant different from that which ſaies, <hi>Do theſe things,</hi> and <hi>Curſed is he,</hi> &amp;c. and they were the ſeeds of that other Law which was to
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:119039:206"/> ſucceed in the place of the ancient one, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bring penitents to ſalvation in that time and intitle them to Life (not by virtue of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Law, but through pure mercy) yet ſuch as were to be more clearly and abundantly revealed. And let them but remark a little what their own Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaies in the 32 <hi>Pſalme; Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered. Bleſſed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guilt. When I kept ſilence, my bones wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed old, through my roaring all the day long. Becauſe day and night thy hand was heavy upon me, my moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is turned into the drought of Summer. I have acknowledged my ſin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I ſaid, I will confeſs my tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the puniſhment of my ſin.</hi> I appeal to themſelves whether this be the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a man that ſeeks the quiet of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in thoſe words of the Law, <hi>Do theſe things and thou ſhalt live?</hi> For the peace of conſcience ariſeth from the hope of life. But when he looks towards the Law, he is deſperate, and hath no peace in his ſoul. His ſatisfaction is in the forgiveneſs of his ſins, and therefore in the aſſurance of mercy. And yet this was <hi>David,</hi> a man according to God's own heart, that ſpoke thus. If therefore ſuch a man as he did not obtain life by virtue of this contract, <hi>Do theſe things,</hi> what other dares claim a right upon ſuch terms? If no man obtaines the ſame upon that account, is it not neceſſary that ſome other Covenant ſucceed, namely that of mercy and grace, in the room of that which was ineffectual? But we proſecute this
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:119039:206"/> too far; Let them hear God himſelf in the 31. Chapter of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> verſ. 31. <hi>Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael and with the houſe of Judah, Not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which my Covenant they brake, although I was an husband to them, ſaith the Lord. But this ſhall be the Covenant which I will make with the houſe of Iſrael; After thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people. And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them, unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their ſin no more.</hi> Who ſees not that he diſtinguiſhes the Covenants by theſe two things? Firſt, that he will give them the grace to violate the New no more; which he did not under the Old. And ſecondly, that he will pardon under the New the tranſgreſſions of the Old, which under it he did not nor could, the denunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the curſe annexed thereunto being irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable. And what can be ſaid more? Does not God in promiſing a New Law foretell the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt? And why ſhould he term this Old, if it ought to be perpetual, ſince perpetual things never wax old, age being a tendency to an end, till the thing growing old comes to be to tally extinguiſh'd. But whereunto then ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd this Law, if none could obtain ſalvation by it? Truely, as Ceremony was a preparation
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:119039:207"/> to that which was to ſucceed and to give the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> ſome taſte and knowledge of it, as in a ſhadow, ſo the old Law was a preparing of the minds of men to receive that which was to be enlarged and communicated under the other. For the more they have attempted to fullfill the Law of the ten Commandments the more have they found by experience of their vain indevours, that they had need of that grace which ingraves the Laws of the Lord upon our minds. The greater knowledge they have had of their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and the curſe which they had incurr'd, the greater neceſſity have they diſcern'd of that Pardon and propitiation which was to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to them under the New Covenant, and breathed more ardently after it. Which ſhall be ſhewn more clearly in the enſuing Chapters.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> That the time of the duration of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law is expired; and conſequently that ſome other muſt be come in its place.</head>
               <p>I Will not examine at preſent the ſolidity of that diſtinction of the Ages of the World made by ſome Jews, That two thouſand years paſs'd before the Law, two thouſand under the Law, and two thouſand more ſhall run out under the reign of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which computation the world is to laſt ſix thouſand years. In the firſt period there will be found a miſ-reckoning, unleſs the two thouſand years of the Law be extended to the firſt Covenant entr'd into with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which indeed contained the principles of it. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt I will not determine; For not onely the diſpoſing of times and ſeaſons is in the hand of God, but to him alone belongs the knowledge of things to come. But as for that in the middle, it is a long time ſince thoſe two thouſand years were expired, not onely counting from the days of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but likewiſe from the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law upon the mountain. And never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, as they think, they do not yet behold the <hi>Meſſias</hi> come; which might be another error in their account. I ſhall only ſay it was very conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly done to make the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſucceed after the Law, as he that was to bring the abrogation of it. For ſince it was to be changed, to whom
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:119039:208"/> could it belong to make that alteration, but to him of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord thy God ſhall raiſe up unto thee a Prophet from the midſt of thee, of thy brethren like unto me; unto him ſhall ye hearken;</hi> And <hi>David, The Lord hath ſworn, and it ſhall not repent him, Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Melchiſedeck;</hi> And all the Prophets, That he was to be a King ſitting upon the throne of <hi>David</hi> and commanding over the Kings and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Earth. For ſince he ought to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet like <hi>Moſes,</hi> he muſt alſo be a Legiſlator and continual Mediator of a Covenant, becauſe it was this which render'd the office of <hi>Moſes</hi> emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent above that of all other Prophets. Now he would be neither Legiſlator nor Mediator of a Covenant, if that of <hi>Moſes</hi> were in force during his reign. Next, In as much as he ought to be a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prieſthood muſt be changed. Laſtly, if he ought to be the King of Kings, he muſt eſtabliſh other ordinances then thoſe enacted by <hi>Moſes</hi> which were onely to rule the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and not to command over Kings themſelves. But further; All the Law, by acknowledgement of the Jews themſelves, tends to the <hi>Meſſias</hi> as to its end, and all the parts of it concentre and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in him. Wherefore if the time prefixed for the coming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> be paſs'd, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity alſo the term of that Law muſt be expir'd. But that it is paſs'd, divers reaſons conſtrain us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; which I ſhall deduce briefly, becauſe others have done it with very exact diligence. And firſt, the Patriark <hi>Jacob,</hi> as we read in the 49 <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ſpoke thus by a prophetick ſpirit, <hi>The
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:119039:208"/> Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, untill that Shiloh be come,</hi> or <hi>till Shiloh come.</hi> That the Scepter and Lawgiver denote the power of political government, both the words ſhew evidently, and the conſent of the Jews themſelves atteſts. And that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is denoted by <hi>Shiloh,</hi> both the titles of the Prince of Peace and Saviour given him in other places, and the ancient Jewiſh Interpreters and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſts do confirm, though there be difficulties made by ſome concerning the ſignification of the word, and the modern Jews quarrel about it. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> comes from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which bears both theſe ſignifications, <hi>To love peace,</hi> and <hi>To ſave;</hi> and the circumſtances of the place diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all interpretation that refers it to any other then the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Wherefore the meaning of this Prophecy is, That the power of the Political Government ſhould not be taken away from that Nation, in which the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably the preheminence, till he that was to bring eternal Peace came into the World. Now concerning the preciſe time when the Political Soveraignty was taken away from <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> I ſhall not at preſent diſpute; it is all one to me whether at ſuch time, when <hi>Herod</hi> having extinguiſh'd the race of the <hi>Aſmoneans,</hi> invaded the Soverainty, or whether the entire ruine of their Government muſt be referr'd to the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their City and Temple, and to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion of their Nation by the <hi>Romanes.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wherewith both theſe opinions are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd being diligently diſcuſſed by Learned men, are of no neceſſity to the matter in hand. It's ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:119039:209"/> apparent that there ha's been no form of Regiment amongſt the Jews for fifteen or ſixteen hundred years. And they of the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> if this promiſe have a particular regard to them, are ſo far from holding the Scepter of that Nation, that all the Jews are univerſally ſubjected to ſtrangers Laws, and their Tribes ſo mingled, as I ſaid above, that there remains no longer any mark of diſtinction of their families. Moreover, there were two Temples at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the Firſt built by King <hi>Solomon,</hi> with ſuch magnificence that no ſtructure in the World was comparable to it; the Second, erected by the Jews upon their return from the Babyloniſh Captivity, ſo mean and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable in reſpect of the other, that the Old men who had ſeen the former, poured forth tears when they beheld it; ſo that the Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> who was preſent at the re-edification, ſpeaks of it in theſe terms, in the 2 <hi>chap.</hi> of his Propheſie, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Who is left among you that ſaw this houſe in her firſt glory? And how do you ſee it now? Is it not in your eyes in compariſon of it as nothing?</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſmallneſs and contemptible form of the building in compariſon of the former, the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Jews obſerve that there wanted five things in it; The preſence of God in the Mercy-Seat; The ſpirit of Prophecy; The celeſtial fire which conſum'd the burnt-offerings; The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thumim;</hi> and the Ark: which added ſuch luſtre and glory one to another. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, how the ſame <hi>Haggai</hi> propheſies of it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Yet once, it is a little while, and I will ſhake the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth and the Sea and the dry land.</hi>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:119039:209"/> Verſ. 7. <hi>And I will ſhake all Nations; and the deſire of all Nations ſhall come, and I will fill this houſe with glory, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Verſ. 9. <hi>The glory of this latter houſe ſhall be greater then of the former, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, and in this place will I give peace.</hi> Now of whom can this be underſtood but of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who was to enter into it, and effectively fill this houſe with glory? What elſe could advance it ſo, as not onely to equal but tranſcend the magnificence of the other? And indeed <hi>Malachy</hi> who liv'd and propheſied at the ſame time, ſpeaks it plainly in the 3. <hi>chap.</hi> verſ. 1. <hi>Behold I will ſend my Meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom ye ſeek, ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple, even the Meſſenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in; Behold, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> They will ſay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that <hi>Haggai</hi> foreſaw that <hi>Herod</hi> would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large and enrich it ſo magnificently, that it ſhould equal or ſurpaſs even that of <hi>Solomon.</hi> And 'tis true as Hiſtories inform us, that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd the ſame to a far greater ſplendor then rhat which the poor returned exiles had given it. But ſeeing all the pompous ſtate that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on it was but the effect of his vaſt and boundleſs ambition, which he expreſs'd almoſt every where by proud ſtructures, as amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the City and Haven of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> to the end his power and greatneſs might be admir'd, and not the divine glory promoted, how could it be agreeable to God to attribute to him the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a man? and even of ſuch a man? who was a ſtranger, if not abſolutely in profeſſion, at leaſt in heart and affection, from his Covenants,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:119039:210"/> and a cruel bloody uſurper of the government of his people? And if it was not well-pleaſing to God that <hi>David</hi> ſhould build him a Temple, becauſe his hands had been bloodied in ſo many wars, which he had manag'd, though very juſt and undertaken out of neceſſity, for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and for the Glory of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, how could he take pleaſure in the vanity of this Monſter, who was formed and elemented of wind and blood and dirt? Beſides, though it had been built all of Saphires and Diamonds, could that glory have rendred it comparable to the leaſt of the five mentioned particulars? or would it have been worth the pains that God ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſhake the Sea and the dry land, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth for it? to cauſe, I ſay, by his infinite power a univerſal change in the face of the World? and to what purpoſe were it to mention the ſhaking of all Nations, to bring the choice of them into that Temple, if there were no more ſignifi'd by it then the proud magnificence of the Pile, and vaſt greatneſs of the Stones? And what Nation ever changed their ſeat to go to ſee it, or to ſend offerings thither by their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors? We ſee therefore the Temple demoliſh'd, and all the attempts made to re-edifie it defeated by a ſpecial demonſtration of the anger of God againſt them that endevour'd it, ſo that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains onely the duſt of its ruines after neer ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years, without ever having been filled with the glory promiſed to it, if the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> be not yet come, as the Jews pretend. In the third place, <hi>Daniel</hi> in the 9. <hi>chap.</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately foretold the time; ſince the expiration of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:119039:210"/> which are paſt a dozen Ages. <hi>Seventy weeks</hi> (ſaith the Angel) <hi>are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy City, to finiſh the tranſgreſſion and to make an end of ſins, and to make reconciliation for ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, and to ſeal up the viſion and prophecy, and to anoint the moſt Holy. Know therefore and underſtand, that from the going forth of the commandment to reſtore and to build Jeruſalem, unto the Meſſiah the Prince, ſhall be ſeven weeks, and threeſcore and two weeks.</hi> That this place ought to be underſtood of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> nothing but obſtinate blindneſs can diſſent; and 'tis very ſtrange that Paſſion ſhould ſo feel up the eyes of ſome of them, that in hatred of our Lord they ſhould interpret it of ſome other. For to whom belongs it but to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> either to be ſtyled the Anointed by way of excellence, or to put an end to Prophecies, or to bring in and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt eternal righteouſneſs, or to make propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for offenſes? Now what is meant by thoſe ſeventy weeks? Septenaries of daies, or weeks, or months, or years, or ages? Of weeks of days, and weeks of years there is frequent mention in the Old Teſtament; of the reſt there occur no examples. And ſurely they cannot underſtand it of Ages, for ſo they would refer the coming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to too remote a diſtance of time; and of fifty thouſand years which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould have foretold, there would he paſs'd little more then two thouſand. And when would they ſee the accompliſhment of their hopes? Therefore they muſt be ſeptenaries of years, or moneths, or weeks, or dayes; and indeed they ought to be underſtood of years.</p>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:119039:211"/>
               <p>But obſerve what their ſubterfuge is, and to what they conſtantly retreat, to defend their opiniaſtry; That indeed the time prefixed by the Prophets for the ſending of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, but 'tis their ſins which hinder them from ſeeing the accompliſhment of thoſe promiſes. By reaſon of them God ha's delay'd the time of their viſitation and deferr'd the exhibition of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſias,</hi> and conſequently prolong'd the term appointed for the duration of the Law: That when they ſhall have perform'd a ſutable repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they ſhall ſee the effect of that which God hath promis'd; at which time, they do not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, but the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall ceaſe. But this Evaſion is vain. For ſuppoſing that God defer'd the ſending of his Anointed, yet at leaſt the Temple ought to have been kept undeſtroy'd, and the Jewiſh Religion maintained in its inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and not ſo dreadful a diſperſion of that Nation to have been ſuffer'd, and ſo total an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolition of all his ſervice. For where are his ſacrifices and his Altars? Why did not He leave ſome uſe of them at leaſt, during the expectance of the accompliſhment of that promiſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11. <hi>From the riſing of the Sun even unto the going down of the ſame, my Name ſhall be great among the Gentiles, &amp; in every place incenſe ſhall be offered unto my Name, and a pure offering?</hi> Let them conſult their own Books. God denounced that he would cauſe the Deluge to come upon the Earth; and he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted it at the ſet time. He promiſed Poſterity to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and gave it him contrary to all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. He foretold the Captivity of his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and it came to paſs, and continued
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:119039:211"/> neither more nor leſs then the four hundred years which he had limited. He promiſed the Deliverance of them from it, and perform'd the ſame faithfully with a thouſand miracles. He foretold the Babyloniſh Captivity, and it did not fail; and he gave in charge to his Prophets to promiſe deliverance from it by means of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> naming him a hundred years before he was born: and with exact fidelity at the end of ſeventy years after their tranſportation into <hi>Babylon,</hi> he brought them back into their own Country by the Edict of that Prince. In a word, all their Hiſtory from the beginning to the End is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with predictions and propheſies, which have had their accompliſhment, without the leaſt defect or miſcarriage. Whence therefore ſhould it be, that in this prediction, which is the foundation of their comfort, and on which all others depend, God ſhould have changed his purpoſe, and by ſo long delays deluded the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the people of the Jews, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf excited in them by his promiſes? Why did not their ſins hinder their deliverance from the hand of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the accompliſhment of that Word, that he would give the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> in heritage to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham?</hi> For they were ſinners at that time as well as now, and beſides inclin'd to Idolatry, a ſin hated by God moſt of all, and which themſelves have at this day in ſo great abhorrence. And ought not the ſame obſtacle to have impeded their return from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon?</hi> They were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners then too, and have always been of the ſame genius, both they and their Anceſtors. And if
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:119039:212"/> by reaſon of ſome more obſtinate perverſneſs in them then in their predeceſſors, God pleas'd to await their repentance for a time, why is that time lengthned out to fifteen or ſixteen hundred years? that is, to three or four times as much time beyond the day prefixed as between the promiſe and the prefixed day it ſelf? Who ever heard tell of ſuch a tedious over-delay, where the Promiſes of God were engaged? And how long doth he attend their repentance? Hath he reſolv'd to give it them, or to expect till they be converted of themſelves, and of their proper motion? For if he expects the ſame from their voluntary and proper motion, all hope of ever ſeeing the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is loſt. Since the horrid deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the burning of the Temple, the ſlaughter of their Nation, the diſperſion of the remainder to the four winds of Heaven, the long ſervitude in which they are, the reproach and ignominy which they endure, the hatred of great and ſmall; and in ſum, all the curſes they could imprecate upon their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, being befallen them, have not been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to mollifie their hearts and convert them, what hope is there that hereafter any thing ſhould move them to repentance? Fifteen or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Ages ſuffice to give us a proof by them and their predeceſſors, what their poſterity will do in this caſe after them. If God himſelf will give it them, and touch their hearts, what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he expects that ſo long time from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he ha's reſolv'd to execute himſelf, and thus to expoſe his fidelity and conſtancy to the tacite ſuſpitions of ſome, and to the cloſe
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:119039:212"/> murmurings or even open blaſphemies of others? Now I wiſh they would conſider this attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Namely, that in their Books God makes two ſorts of Promiſes to them; Some are founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Condition, and others are (as they ſpeak) Simple and Abſolute. As for thoſe which are ſounded upon a condition, ſhould God have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed a certain time for performance, yet ought not he be accus'd of inconſtance, though he ſhould defer it beyond the term, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ha's not as yet been accompliſh'd. For where the obligation is reciprocal, and ſome thing is to be done firſt on the part of men, why ſhould any think God oblig'd to perform that which he promiſed not but under ſome previous condition? Are we wont to act thus one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another? And of this Nature are the Legal promiſes, that is, the Promiſes of Life and Bleſſing upon a firm continuance in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. For by ſaying, If thou continue in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of my Commandments, I will give thee all ſorts of bleſſings, he do's perpetually imply, that in caſe of deviating from them the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all thoſe Benedictions is fruſtrated. For the other, which are abſolute, and not depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on any condition, to fail to effect them is to be wanting to his own conſtancy. And why ſhould God have been ſo forward as to promiſe abſolutely, and yet retract it afterwards upon ſo groundleſs a pretence? This is the practiſe of vain men, who promiſe raſhly; and afterwards repenting of the matter, ſeek out excuſes and pretexts to put off the effect, and veil their levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now let any man read the Old Teſtament
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:119039:213"/> from end to end, and he will find that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes concerning the <hi>Meſſias</hi> are ſo far from being founded on any precedaneous condition on the part of men, that they are not ſo much Promiſes as ſetled and determined Predictions. Or if they ought to be called Promiſes (as indeed they are, ſince they are predictions of a Good to come, which muſt afford incomparable benefit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment) they are promiſes in which the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy of the infinite God ſeems to wraſtle againſt the obſtinacy of men. As ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> was fallen, God, without being invited thereunto by his repentance, even without ſpeaking to him, ſaies to the Serpent, <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed; it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> Can it be ſuſpected here, that without the foregoing penitence of men, theſe words ſhall never be accompliſht? On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is to excite our repentance, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would have remained dead; for they are the promiſes of Grace, which alone (as we have ſaid elſewhere) can awaken the minds of men to true repentance. In like manner, when the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaies, <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah,</hi> &amp;c. Does he underſtand that <hi>Shiloh</hi> ſhall come, onely provided <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? Certainly he had no regard to that; but puts this among the abſolute pure predictions, which the Spirit ennabled him to make concerning his Poſterity, and the things which were to happen to every Tribe, were it repentant, or not. And thus it is alſo in all the reſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18. <hi>I will raiſe them up a Prophet among their brethren, like unto
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:119039:213"/> thee, and will put my words in his mouth and he ſhall ſpeak unto them all that I ſhall command him.</hi> Verſ. 19. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs that whoſoever will not hearken unto my words, which he ſhall ſpeak in my Name, I will require it of him.</hi> Pſal. 2. <hi>I have ſet my King upon Sion the mountain of my holineſs.</hi> And 7. The <hi>Lord hath ſaid to me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> 8. <hi>Ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the Nations for thy inheritance, and the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the Earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron, thou ſhall daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſel,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 7.14. <hi>Behold, A virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his name Immanuel.</hi> Alſo chap. 11.1. <hi>And there ſhall come forth a rod out of the ſtemne of Ieſſe, and a Branch ſhall grow out of his Roots.</hi> 2. <hi>And the Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo chap. 32.1. <hi>Behold, a King ſhall reign in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. And likewiſe in that celebrated 53. chapter. And <hi>Malachi</hi> having ended the ſecond chapter with a complaint of the murmurings of the Jews againſt the Providence of God, and likewiſe of their blaſphemies, he continues his diſcourſe thus, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold, I will ſend my meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom ye ſeek, ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple,</hi> &amp;c. As if he would either break the heart of thoſe Rebels by this admirable effect of an incredible goodneſs, or warrant his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from blame by the execution of his immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table decrees. But above all things, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> above alledged is remarkable. For after having ſo clearly ſet down the time of the birth of Chriſt, he adds (<hi>verſ.</hi> 26.) And after
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:119039:214"/> ſcore and two weeks ſhall <hi>Meſſias</hi> be cut off, but not for himſelf: and the people of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> deſolations are determin'd. Now I beſeech you, had not this its event in <hi>Titus</hi> and the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed the City of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and burnt the Temple to aſhes? How then could the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Deſolation have been accompliſh't which was not to happen till after the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the Promiſe, if the Promiſe were not executed before, ſeeing they are both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſame Prophecy?</p>
               <p>It remains therefore, that ſince as it is not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for men to exempt themſelves from ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no to Divine Inſtitutions ſo long as they are in force, ſo neither is it lawful to extend them longer then the term appointed to them by God himſelf admits; the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> having paſs'd its time, either there is now no longer any form of Religion of divine inſtitution in the World, or that ſome other hath been eſtabliſh'd by God in its place. For as to what they alledge, that in ſeveral places of their Books, it is ſaid that their Law ought to endure to perpetuity, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it hath been anſwered a thouſand times that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> taken ſimply, do's not neceſſarily ſignifie the perpetuity of a thing, or eternity of time, but oftentimes a long dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely, which began or is terminated at ſome certain and remarkable period, as of the Deluge, of the deſcent into <hi>Egypt,</hi> of a Jubilee, and the like; Examples of which are very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:119039:214"/> Now it would be a thing too unſutable to that great goodneſs which God hath always teſtified to men, and to that ſpecial care he hath had to bring them to the knowledge of himſelf and by that to ſalvation, to have aboliſh'd and ſuppreſs'd the true Religion without ſubſtituting another in its ſtead. He hath always ſhewn that he loves the Political or Civil Societies of men, which onely have relation to the conſervation of their rights and civil comportments among themſelves: how much dearer then is the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a Religious Society to him, in which the importance is concerning the preſervation of his rights over us, actions of piety and virtue, and the eternal ſalvation of our ſouls? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it would be a too ſtrange inequality in the proceedings of a Nature ſo wiſe and uniform as the Divine, to have employ'd ſo great exact di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in preſcribing and delineating the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jews and in all the order of it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to deſtroy the ſame totally without rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing another upon its ruines. And it would be too great a lightneſs in ſo conſtant a nature to have promiſed his Church in ſo many places of the Old Teſtament to cauſe her to ſubſiſt eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (and what is the Church, but a Society re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated according to the Laws of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) and yet to ſubvert it utterly beyond all apparent poſſibility of reſtoration. Wherefore there ha's ſucceeded ſome other Religion in place of the Jewiſh. But it can be neither the Pagan, nor the Mahometane; and therefore it muſt neceſſarily be the Chriſtian. And this is the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:119039:215"/> buſineſs to be deduc'd more at large in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> That the Chriſtian Religion, being more excellent, hath ſucceeded the Jewiſh.</head>
               <p>SO numerous is the ſtore of things that offer themſelves for the proof of what the title of this Chapter promiſeth, that I beſeech the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers indulgence if I omit ſome. Should I do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, it would be impoſſible to proportion this piece to the reſt of the work. I ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the author of the Chriſtian Religion and his principal Miniſters were Jews, and ſo intereſſed and engaged, according to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtinct of all Nations, to the maintenance of their own Religion, if it ought to have been perpetually durable; Nor that it was firſt of all to their own Nation that they adreſſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the ſame to them, and did not turn to the Gentiles, but onely after they had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and perſecuted by the Jews. Nor that the Pagans converted by their preaching pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd to be only gathered to the Jewiſh Nation, and inſerted like a wild graſſe into a natural ſtock. I ſhall onely compare the two Religions together, ſo to manifeſt the excellence of the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:119039:215"/> Chriſtian above the Jewiſh, and that not onely in things wherein they differ, but alſo in ſuch as they agree together in: for ours will be found to have in either reſpect ineſtimable advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it. And this will be ſufficient for the proof of my propoſition. For ſince the Jewiſh was of divine inſtitution, if the Chriſtian be more excellent, it muſt have been drawn from the ſame treaſures of his celeſtial Wiſdome, who enlargeth and augmenteth his favours as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as for the things they agree in, ſeeing the Chriſtian Religion acknowledges that the Books of the Jews are not onely true but divine, and conſequently accords with them as to all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hiſtories recorded therein, of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, the formation of man, the propagation of mankind, the deſtruction of the ſame by the Flood, the reſtoring of it by the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Noah,</hi> the conflagration of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the calling of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in <hi>Egypt</hi> and the Wilderneſs, the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances by the Judges, the eſtabliſhment of Kings, the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the like; And that the Chriſtian Religion ha's retained the doctrines revealed therein as inviolable, being of eternal and immutable truth; As, that there is but one God infinite in eſſence and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that all the petty Deities of the Pagans are trifles; that he is the puniſher of Vice and the rewarder of Piety and Virtue, by ſutable penalties and recompenſes both for the body and the ſoul; that all creatures ow him honour and obedience, both becauſe they hold their being
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:119039:216"/> from him, and in regard of his infinite majeſty; that their beatitude conſiſts in their communion with him, and their ruine and extream miſery in their elongation from him; that he is the author of all the good that is in them, and therefore to him onely is praiſe and thankſgiving to be rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; And alſo that it profeſſes to embrace the promiſes of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> in the exhibition of whom the Jews place all the hope of their felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and glory: It might ſeem that in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars and the like, the Chriſtians ought not ſo much to be held to have ſucceeded the Jews as to be Jews themſelves; or indeed rather the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Jews to have been Chriſtians, in as much as theſe are the foundation of Chriſtianity laid by the Prophets, and upon which, to ſpeak ſtrictly, all the faith and piety of their anceſtors was built. Nevertheleſs, the Chriſtian Law is not without greater advantages herein, as having diffuſed theſe doctrines without compariſon more univerſally then the Jewiſh ever did. For God being not onely the God of Jews, but of all people in the world equally, in as much as he framed all of the ſame blood, it is more ſutable to the goodneſs of his nature to communicate the knowledge of his Name to all Nations, to Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South, then to hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as it were included within the bounds of <hi>Iudaea:</hi> and it cannot be denyed but that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with a more glorious example of his love to mankind, by uniting them together in a Society more ſtrait then that of humanity it ſelf, then he did ſometimes by the Law of the Jews, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their God, their Laws, their Ceremonies, and
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:119039:216"/> their hopes apart, look't upon all other Nations as profane, and entertain'd no communion with them. And certainly were not the Jews blinded by their paſſions, they would acknowledge in this not only the excellence of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion above their own, but alſo that the Author of it was the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed by the Prophets. For there is nothing ſo clear in all their Scriptures as the prediction of the calling of the Gentiles at the appearing of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as was ſhewn above; and the day is not ſo clear, as it is evident that this Promiſe hath been accompliſht by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel. For did not the preaching of the Apoſtles aim at the reducing of the Gentiles from the ſervice of Idols to the knowledge of the God of <hi>Abraham?</hi> Did not they wage a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and irreconcileable War againſt falſe Deities? Did they not overthrow their Temples, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh their Altars, with the ſound of their voices? Are not the very names of the Idols of the Pagans obliterated out of the memory of men in the greateſt part of the world? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whom the <hi>Iews</hi> held for aliens from the true God, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which both of them accounted Barbarians in <hi>Aſia, Europe, Africa;</hi> even the Savages of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which were unknown to them, have done homage to the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> acknowledge the Jews for thoſe that heretofore alone ſerv'd him, venerate their Scriptures, aſcribe to their Law the prerogative of being the onely rule of piety and virtue, reverence their Prophets as heralds of the Divine Will, have caſt off and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd all their images. What do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:119039:217"/> further? Such a univerſal mutation in the whole face of the Univerſe, ſuch a marvellous converſion of the hearts of ſo many Nations, in all parts of the World, can they judge poſſible to have been made without a ſpecial divine aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? Certainly either this Propheſie, <hi>The Earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the bottom of the Sea with waters that cover it,</hi> ha's been accompliſh'd in the preaching of the Goſpel, or it will never be accompliſh'd at all. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chriſtian Religion hath this advantage in this reſpect above the Jewiſh, that God ſhews himſelf in it more affectionate and good towards men, and 'tis his property to be good; that men have more powerful inducements by this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to be good one towards another, in which conſiſts their perfection; and laſtly that it ha's this indubitable evidence of the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then in reference to things in which they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; they are of many ſorts. And as we above diſtinguiſh'd the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> into three parts; the Political, the Ceremonial, and the Moral, we will now conſider each of them diſtinctly by it ſelf in brief. And firſt for the Political, it needs not much to inſiſt upon that, becauſe it do's not ſo directly regard Religion; and yet it muſt not be wholly paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>over in ſilence. How exact therefore ſo ever it was, and congruous to the Nature of that people, yet it cannot be denyed but the Chriſtian Religion which hath left to all Nations the free uſe of their own Laws, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that honeſty and equity be reſplendent in their policy, wherewith all the actions of men
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:119039:217"/> ought to be temper'd, is in this point preferable before it many degrees. For ſeeing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and ground-work of Political Laws is proportionate to and do's not exceed humane reaſon, and therefore the conſtitution and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of thoſe Laws depends on Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it is a very evident teſtimony that God greatly diſtruſted the prudence of the people of the Jews, when he took care to preſcribe to them even in the leaſt matter, and to give them, as their Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Precept after precept, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept after precept, line after line, line after line.</hi> But having diffus'd over all Nations a ſpirit of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and wiſdom, by the publication of the Goſpel, to adminiſter their affairs with ſage and good conduct, it was conſentaneous that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing of their reſpective Laws ſhould be permitted to themſelves. And this turns both to the great adorning of the Univerſe and to the ſingular praiſe of the divine Wiſdom. For as the Wiſdom of God is more illuſtrous in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motions of the Heavens, of which ſome are ſlow, others more rapid, ſome tend towards the Eaſt, &amp; others to the Weſt, &amp; yet from all of them at laſt reſults that excellent harmony on which the conſervation of the World and the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all things in the Univerſe depends, then if were no variety at all in their courſes; And as in the Earth the different ſtreams of Rivers, of which ſome glide ſo gently that their motion is ſcarce preceptible, others ruſh with violence like torrents, each according to the manner of the places through which they paſs, ſome flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the North, others towards the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:119039:218"/> South, and all in the mean while come from the Sea and return thither again; do much more grace and adorn the face of the World, then if they all kept the ſame equal and uniform tract; So without doubt there appears a greater Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the conduct of ſo many Nations ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified by various ſorts of Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Monarchical, Ariſtocratical, Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and mixt, each according to its peculiar ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, all which nevertheleſs conſpire to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of one and the ſame God, and aſpire to the atchievment of one and the ſame hope, then if they were all modell'd and policyed according to the ſame conſtitutions. Beſides, that God being willing that Chriſtians ſhould be people of free courage, and erected to that honeſt liberty which is worthy of generous and noble ſouls, it ha's pleaſed him that men ſhould exerciſe the actions of Juſtice and virtue no otherwiſe then by following the ſuggeſtions of a nature, almoſt reſtored by ſo excellent a Religion to its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive integrity; ſo that every one ſhould be a Law unto himſelf. It is true, that a good part of the Nations which in theſe dayes make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Chriſtian Name, do not ſhew that a doctrine ſo heavenly ha's been efficacious to cleanſe the vitioſity of nature, and repreſs the diſorder of their paſſions; ſo that there may ſeem need of more Laws to prevent frauds and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But this is the corruption of theſe dregs of Ages. And he that would know what Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charity and the uprightneſs of thoſe that have embrac'd this Law, is, muſt not conſider it ſuch as
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:119039:218"/> it is at the preſent time, but in the firſt Ages of the Church.</p>
               <p>As for the Ceremonial Law, 'tis the Chriſtian Religion alone that teaches us to underſtand the uſe of it, by manifeſting the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to which it aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For by that we are inſtructed that the whole ſtructure of the Tabernacle, and all the Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the ſervice which was performed therein by external and ſenſible things did refer to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual verities and virtues. So that as much as the knowledge of divine myſteries and admirable doctrines, tranſcends things obvious to ſenſe, by ſo much is the Chriſtian Doctrine and the fruits produced by it more excellent then the Moſaical Worſhip. It would be too long to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goriſe all that pertains to it; the matter will be evident by two or three examples. There were two eminent Sacraments; Circumciſion, and the Paſchal Lambe. To take them according to the conſtruction of the Jews what other ſignification had they but onely to ſeparate the people of the Jews, and to diſcriminate them from other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and be a commemoration of their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the death of the Firſt-born? The one was a token imprinted in the fleſh of a Covenant that ſeem'd to regard onely the body, and the other a memorial of a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance meerly temporal. Now we have learnt from the Chriſtian Religion that the Firſt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to repreſent the need we ſtood in that this corrupt nature of ours which we derive from our fathers by ordinary generation, ſhould be retrenched, if we would have part in the ſpiritual Covenant with God; and the Second
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:119039:219"/> to be a type of him, of whom it was ſaid, <hi>He was lead like a Lamb to the ſlaughter,</hi> and whoſe blood and death ſecured our ſouls from the dreadful and univerſal deſtruction, to which otherwiſe they were obnoxious. And in this we do no more but follow the traces which themſelves have hereof in the Prophets, but could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. To this purpoſe is their ſpeaking of and exhorting to the circumciſion of the heart, as in contempt of that which was made in the fleſh; and alſo that of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s diligent injunction to ſprinkle the blood of the Paſchal Lambe upon the poſts and treſſell of the houſe, and that it ſhould be a perpetual inſtitution in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For what virtue had the blood of a Lamb to divert the ſword of an Angel, and to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the houſes of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the calamity of others?</p>
               <p>There was moreover preſcrib'd by it ſeveral waſhings and purifications for the veſſels and utenſils of the Tabernacle, houſes and garments infected with any pollution, for men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſeiſed on by ſome natural infirmity; things which were accounted unclean, if all theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries were not ſolicitouſly obſerved. The Goſpel hath taught us that all this repreſents true ſanctification, which cleanſes the corrupt appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of man, and purifies his conſcience. And truly, otherwiſe to what end or benefit ſerved all theſe waſhings, if they did not deſign ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe? Or why ſhould corporeal and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inevitable infirmities, ſuch as the Lunar flux of women, debarre them from communion with God and his Tabernacle, but onely as figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:119039:219"/> thoſe voluntary ones of the conſcience? In this alſo we have the authority of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; It is ſaid in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> chap. 36.25. <hi>I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean: from all your filthineſs, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you.</hi> But how? <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you; and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh. And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes,</hi> &amp;c. Now by how much piety and the internal virtue of the ſoul is better then the cleanneſs of the body, ſo much is the recommendation and doctrine of the one more excellent then the obſervation of the other. But this appears remarkably in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of the Ceremonial Law, namely in the Sacrifices. For the death of beaſts being, as we intimated formerly, incapable to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for ſins, and yet it being a thouſand times expreſſed in the Law, that thoſe victimes were appointed for propitiation, what remains but that they were deſtinated as types for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of a Sacrifice, which in truth made real and ſufficient propitiation for offenſes? And indeed what elſe could the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> have referr'd to, when he ſaid, <hi>chap.</hi> 53.6. <hi>All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of us all. He was brought as a Lambe to the ſlaughter; and as a ſheep before the Shearers is dumbe, ſo he opened not his mouth.</hi> Eſpecially, ſince the blood of Bulls and Goats had no virtue for the purification of ſouls, and yet the High Prieſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred every year into the Holy of Holies with
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:119039:220"/> blood in the preſence of the Arke of the Lord, as if he had gone to offer ſatisfaction for the ſins committed by the People, what had this been but a vain and empty ceremony, in caſe it did not typifie One, who in the quality of great and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verain Prieſt entred into the preſence of God in the Heavens, with real ſatisfaction for the ſins of men? Truly the reſemblance is admirable, Onely once a year (a period of time in which the world ſeems to exiſt a new, grow up, wax old, and terminate its duration, by the revolution and ſucceſſion of the four ſeaſons) the High Prieſt ſlew in the Tabernacle, but in a place ſeparated with a veil from the Ark, a ſacrifice for the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the whole people: and once in the whole duration of the World, a Man devoted thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to offers himſelf in ſacrifice, and ſuffers death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, a place remote from the preſence of God, and ſever'd from his eſpecial manſion by the extent of the Heavens as with a veil, to the end to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tain remiſſion to all them that ſeek it. This being done, the High Prieſt took the blood of the Victime, and preſum'd to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Moſt-holy place within the veil, and to appear before the Mercy-Seat: And the ſame Man, Holy and without ſpot, after having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in the World, taking confidence from his ſufferings, as having ſatisfy'd the juſtice of God, dares attempt to aſcend into the Heavens, and paſs beyond the veil to preſent himſelf before the Lord in the habitation of his glory. For he no longer dreaded his preſence, having undergone all his wrath. Laſtly, the High Prieſt, dipping his finger in the blood ſprinkled it ſeven times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:119039:220"/> the Mercy-ſeat; Now the Septenary is a number of perfection, as the Jews themſelves acknowledge: And the ſame Man, who ſuffer'd death for the remiſſion of ſins, being entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy of Holies in the Heavens, abides there untill the conſummation of Ages, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his ſacrifice continually before God, and by this his interceſſion to render him eternally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious unto us. Let them therefore conſider a little without paſſion or prejudice the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and reſemblance diſtinctly. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in all that external ſervice, God had regard to ſomething to come, what better interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be made of this myſtery, then that the ſacrifice of a beaſt prefigures that of a man; the expiation of a corporeal defilement, a ſpiritual purification; the place where the victime was ſlain, the World; the veil, the Heavens; the Moſt holy place, where the Ark was, the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Gods's glorious reſidence; and the ſprinkling made by the High Prieſt, the perpetual interceſſion of him that offered up himſelf by the Eternal Spirit? Wherefore let them either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this explication thereof made by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, or ſtudy to give more congruous and ſutable. Which I aſſure my ſelf, their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to effect will be ſo vain, and all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions ſo extravagant, that in reſpect of ours they will be but as darkneſs in compariſon of light. But that all theſe typical repreſentations have been really acted and accompliſh'd, ſhall by the help of God, appear hereafter with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant evidence.</p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:119039:221"/>
               <p>Now if our Chriſtian Religion be thus excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent above that of the Jews in the underſtanding and application of their own Ceremonies, it is alſo far ſuperior to it in thoſe which Chriſtianity it ſelf practiſes; of which indeed it ought not to be deſtitute. And firſt, it is highly advantageous to us, that they are few in number, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently leſs painful and laborious. Next, that they are leſs carnal and material, as not being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances of a Religion which ſeem'd to conſiſt wholly in out-ſide, in the mean while till the ſpiritual things which it promiſed were really exhibited. And laſtly, that they are euchariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and commemorative of that truely propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſacrifice, which ha's been already offered, and by conſequence more proper to beget piety in our mindes, becauſe they repreſent and apply things paſt to us, of which we have a perfect and cleare knowledge; whereas the Jewiſh figur'd the ſame as future, obſcure, and in a riddle. Moreover, he that ſhall duly conſider the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal face of the true Church, its exerciſes of devotion, its pompous ſimplicity and modeſt magnificence, ſinging, publick and ſolemn pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; due celebration of its myſteries without I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry or Superſtition, and on the other ſide without contempt of a Being ſo worthy of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found admiration and reverence, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent cuſtom of inſtructing the people by Preaching, and diſpenſing the Chriſtian Doctrine to edification and comfort by exhortations and convenient reprehenſions; will find that there is a more pleaſing and comely ſpectacle in the order of its divine miniſtry, then in that butchery
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:119039:221"/> of ſacrifices which was made in the Tabernacle, where it was neceſſary to be always imployed in waſhing and cleanſing away the blood and ſcouring all the utenſiles of the ſervice from the ſoile and fat of ſacrifices. And it may be alſo obſerved, that whereas the Jewiſh Religion ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted the mind to ſenſible things, affording them but very little taſte of ſpiritual and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual; as 'tis the cuſtome to retain children and inſtruct them in groſs and ſenſual things for that their reaſon is yet but weak, and they live prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally according to the guidance of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; On the contrary, in the Chriſtian Religion men are reclaimed from ſenſe to underſtanding, ſo that what is ſenſible in it is not capable to arreſt our minds on it, although it be profitable to lead us to the uſe of ſpiritual things, where with our ſouls are abundantly fed and ſatisfied; and this becauſe that the Church under this Religion is come to perfect Age, being indued with far greater ſtrength of reaſon and underſtanding to comprehend them. This the Prophets firſt taught us, who have ſpoken ſo diſdainfully of all thoſe external ceremonies of the Moſaical Law, as we have ſeen above, in compariſon of the internal virtues of the Soul. And indeed nature it ſelf would teach us the ſame; though they had been wholly ſilent of it. For ſince man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compos'd of body and ſoul, is principally man by the faculties of reaſon and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Religion which conſiſts rather in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal exerciſes, then in the inſtruction and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionating of the mind, muſt be judged infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely inferior to that which is concerned
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:119039:222"/> principally and almoſt ſolely about the Soul.</p>
               <p>As for the Decalogue, it ha's not been leſs illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the preaching of the Goſpel then the other: Not that there ha's been any thing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to piety and good manners taught by the Goſpel which was not compris'd in the Moral Law; Since this Rule of Juſtice and Perfection ha's been alwayes like to it ſelf in all Ages. But the underſtanding of it having been corrupted partly by the hypocriſie and partly by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs of men, the Chriſtian Religion ha's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd it to its primitive purity and reſtor'd it to the higheſt pitch of its natural perfection. The Jewiſh Doctors upon this Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> thought that it was enough to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from the effuſion of blood, and otherwiſe either juſtified or excuſed wrath, deſires of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and words of ſpight and ſcorn. The Chriſtian Excellency teaches us, that 'tis not the external act of murder only that is forbidden, but even the leaſt motions of the mind that carry to revenge, the moſt looſe thoughts of miſchief, and the ſlighteſt words uttered in offenſe to our neighbor, either by deriſion or outrage. Then which what is more agreeable both to the nature of God who is ſo good, and who is not the judge onely of actions, but likewiſe of cogitations; and to the nature of man, whoſe outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are neither good nor evil, but onely ſo far as they proceed from the good or evil ſource of the internal affections? Upon this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the act indeed which defiles the bed of ones neighbor; wanton thoughts and laſcivious
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:119039:222"/> glances they made no great reckning of. The Chriſtian Religion teaches that he that looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wife of his neighbor with deſire after her, hath committed adultery in his heart. Then which what is more ſutable to the holineſs of God and more reaſonable in reference to that which ought to be in men? For what great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage were it to have kept the body unpollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with filthy actions, if yet the ſoul ſhould be full of impure cogitations? <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Laws, the adminiſtring and ſuperintendency of which belong'd to the Magiſtrate alone, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the retribution <hi>of Eye for Eye and Tooth for Tooth,</hi> that ſo the violence of outrages might be repreſs'd by the fear of a penalty ſemblable and adequate to each ſort of crime. The Jewiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors extended this to private revenges, as if they had been permitted by this ſanction. But the Chriſtian Purity reforms this error by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a man ought to be ſo far from doing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reaſon for an injury, that it is more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to be ſo diſpos'd as to receive and diſpenſe with reiterated wrongs and inſolences. Then which what is more befitting them that believe there is a God in Heaven, who preſerves the rights of every one, who watches over all by his Providence, and who hath declar'd that vengeance belongs to himſelf? And thus alſo it is in the Law of Divorce and Polygamy, abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Goſpel, which reduces marriage to the eſtate of its primitive inſtitution, an eſtate ſo worthy and becoming in regard of its natural honeſty, and ſo recommended even by their own Prophets. And truely, what likelihood is
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:119039:223"/> there, the Jews ſhould be leſt to eternity in that ancient hardneſs of heart for which it had been indulg'd to them, or that the example of the Jewiſh incon inence ſhould be made authentick in other Nations? So alſo concerning light and unprofitable Swearing, which the Doctors of the Jews tolerated, provided exact care were us'd to perform what was incumbent by virtue of the oath; Chriſtian Religion ha's aboliſht the ſame as a profanation of the holy and ſacred Name of God, which muſt not be pronounced but with great reverence. And is not this to reduce men from the ſhell to the marrow of the Law, from the outſide to the inſide, from the body to the ſoul, and even to the moſt ſpiritual part of the ſoul? And that theſe and ſuch like have been the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which the Doctors of the Jews have introduc'd in their Law, the teſtimonies are but too frequent in their Books.</p>
               <p>But there is yet ſomething further conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. For there are two things in every good Law; Firſt the Righteouſneſs of the command which it contains; and Secondly, the Right of puniſhment due to the tranſgreſſion of it: both which ariſe from the natural difference which is between Vice and Virtue, and their neceſſary appendances, Puniſhment and Reward. Now Chriſtianity hath not onely reduc'd the Law to its integrity in relation to the firſt, but hath alſo wonderfully illuſtrated it in the ſecond; in which the Ignorance of men had debas'd it two ways. For firſt, if there were ſome among the Jews that had a little deeper knowledge in the Nature of the Law, and eſteem'd it the rule not
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:119039:223"/> onely of actions or intentions accompliſht but alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f thoughts, yet they accounted ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in thought or word onely ſo light, that they ſcarce believ'd God ought to inflict any puniſhment for them, and judged them very ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial in themſelves. Secondly, though in ſins per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated by ſcandalous actions they beheld a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude, which deſerv'd ſevere chaſtiſement, yet they had all this opinion that God would readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgive them without other ſatisfaction then by pitiful ſacrifices. Perhaps, not that they thought ſacrifices could impretate remiſſion by their own value, as being equivalent to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved penalty (for to believe ſo, they muſt have been too like the victimes which they jugulated) But becauſe God remitting the ſame freely, was contented with the acknowledgement made of the demerit by killing the ſacrifice. For every man that ſlayeth a beaſt in his own ſtead, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that he hath deſerved death. But the Goſpel hath reſtored it in this point to its priſtine Majeſty, and reinſtated it in the prerogative of a ſevere avenger of the ſins of men; for as we ſhall ſee hereafter, the belief of its inexorable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity in this point conduces highly to conciliate honor and reverence to it. Firſt then, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath taught men that thoſe which they lookt upon as piccadillo ſins according to the cuſtome of the world, are of a henious nature when weighed in the balance of God's juſtice, ſo that men are to give account even of their idle words; and that the moſt inward thoughts of their minds, the leaſt ticklings of their appetites, if they be diſſonant from the rules of the Law,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:119039:224"/> which require a perfection in which nothing can be impeached, render men obnoxious to the curſe that is annexed to it. And truely ſhould not the Goſpel affirm it, the Law it ſelf holds forth as much. For I demand whether the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue does not contain the rule of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and conſummated perfection that can and ought to be in humane nature? If it does not, then ſeeing all things which can concern the Moral perfection of man that are neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded nor prohibited in this Law, are reputed as <hi>mean,</hi> that is, neither good nor evil, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in themſelves, it will follow that there may be ſome defect of moral perfection in man, which nevertheleſs ſhall not be at all reprovable: for mean and indifferent things, whether they be done or not, bring neither praiſe nor blame. So that a man that ha's all the moral perfection which the Law requires, but yet ſailes of that which it does not, ſhall notwithſtanding merit as much praiſe as he which ha's that which it commands not, and that which it does command together. Which is as abſurd, as if one ſhould ſay that an Angle made with a right Line and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that cuts the ſame <hi>decuſſatim,</hi> deſerv's as well the title of a right Angle, as that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of two right Lines, one of which falls perpendicularly upon the other. For it is not more neceſſary to an angle that it be compos'd of two right lines, whereof one falls perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly upon the other, to be approv'd for a right angle; then it is neceſſary to a man to have all moral perfections poſſible, in order to being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with humane perfection. Moreover, the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:119039:224"/> Decalogue being nothing but the renewing of the Natural Law, which was for a rule of Life to the firſt man in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and of which he with his poſterity loſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by Sin, it would be requiſite, ſutable to that opinion, to preſuppoſe that <hi>Adam</hi> in his firſt creation was not indued with all moral perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required in humane nature. Which indeed would be an affront to him that formed him. But I beſeech you, do not the praiſes wherewith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> extolls the Law of God, conſtrain us to have a more advantageous eſteem of it. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect</hi> (ſaith he in the 19. Pſalm) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the ſoul: the Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple. The Statutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart; the Commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightning the eyes.</hi> And in the 119. Pſalm, he prayes for nothing elſe but that God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ould illuminate him in the knowledge of the Law, that he might walk in his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as being the rule of all perfection deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; which is alſo extreme frequent through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole book of his ſacre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Hymnes. But if the Law contains the meaſure of the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and accompliſht perfection that can be in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature; then ſince the denunciation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, that <hi>Curſed is he who abideth not ſtedfaſt in all the things of this Law to do them,</hi> he is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſubject to the malediction that deviates from this Law, and omits or commits the leaſt thing forbidden or commanded by it. But a curſe denounced by the mouth of God himſelf, cannot but be unconceivably dreadful and hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:119039:225"/>
               <p>In the next place, the Goſpel teaches that the Law is ſo inflexible in its rights, that 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, after having tranſgreſs'd it, whether in a ſmall or great matter, to be acquitted from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, ſo as not to ſuffer the ſame either in proper perſon, or in that of ſome other. Which to an intelligent conſiderer even the Law it ſelf ſufficiently teſtifies. For it denounces on the one ſide an inevitable curſe to them that tranſgreſs it, God himſelf pronouncing the ſame from the mountain of <hi>Sinai,</hi> with lightnings and thund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſmoke and flaſhes of Fire, and earthquakes. On the other ſide gratuitous remiſſion of offenſes is promiſed to them that have violated it. Now what expedient is there to fill up the abyſſe which is between theſe extremes? Shall that pardon be granted without preceding puniſhment? If ſo, what need was there of ſuch terror at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of this Law, and after to ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> all thoſe horrible menaces of malediction vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thus in ſmoke? Perhaps, God powers all the Curſe upon the victimes inſtituted upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſacrifices of propitiation: and 'tis true they are termed expiatory a hundred and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times. But what a kind of Comedy would it be, if God after himſelf had publiſh'd his Law with ſuch dreadful majeſty, ſhould be contented, for ſatisfaction of the tranſgreſſing of it, with the death of a poor beaſt? Might not that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age be here applyed,
<q>Parturiunt montes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> It remaines therefore that thoſe terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:119039:225"/> muſt either fall upon them that violate the Law, or upon ſome other capable to bear the ſame, ſubſtitute in their room, that ſo they may be ſecur'd from them. And the glory of the Law remains hereby more full and intire. For Reward being a ſequel not more natural to Virtue, then Puniſhment is to Vice, the Law which denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a Curſe for tranſgreſſion, and yet does not really inflict the ſame, is as imperfect as that which ſhould promiſe a reward to its obſervers, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when it came to the effect, fruſtrate all their expectations. As he that ſhould have fulfilled the Law in every point, would have cauſe to complain of it, if in caſe he reaped not the recompenſe of his piety and virtue, ſo would the Law have cauſe of complaint if he that viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, did not undergo the penalty of his offence: the natural order of things alike requiring both the one and the other. And from hence reſults a thing which turns marvellouſly to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Chriſtian Religion above the Jewiſh; Namely, that it repreſents to us the principal At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God, in which his uſual wayes conſiſt, as his Juſtice, Mercy, and Wiſdome, in a much more eminent degree of excellence. For as for his Juſtice, it is nothing but a natural repugnanee that is between him and ſin; by reaſon his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is good and holy, and the eſſence of ſin (as they ſpeak) conſiſts in iniquity and pollution; a repugnance, I ſay, which neceſſarily inclines him to the hatred and abhorrence of ſin. For he were not God, unleſs he hated Evill. Now all Hatred is a vehement deſire of revenge; and hence it is that in their books this Juſtice is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:119039:226"/> 
                  <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Fury,</hi> and even an <hi>ardent Fury.</hi> Whence we infer, that accordingly as God is perfect in himſelf, ſo he abhors Evil; and as he perfectly abhors it, ſo he is equally inclin'd to execute vengeance upon it. Wherfore the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion which teaches that God ha's not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the World without being revenged, I ſay, not without taking ſatisfaction convenient to his Juſtice, exhibits the ſame to be conſider'd in a more eminent degree, then that which holds forth remiſſion without inflicting deſerved ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. For ſince the hatred of ſin is a virtue in God, the more implacable this hatred is the greater is the virtue. There are indeed three ſorts of ſatisfactions: Firſt, ſuch as is made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire a dammage received; as if one ſhould give a Statuary money for having broken an Image in his ſhop. Secondly, ſuch as is in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting an incenſed Paſſion; as when we ſtrike one by whom we have been offended. For though no good accrue to us by his harm, yet the paſſion is contented by being revenged. Thirdly, a ſatisfaction of Juſtice, when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard either to dammage or indignation, a crime is expiated by puniſhment for the ſole love of righteouſneſs and the natural order which ought to be in things. Now the firſt hath no place in God; for what dammage can ariſe to him from our offenſes? Nor the ſecond: For he is not ſubject to our Paſſions; choler, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity do not diſcompoſe his ſerenity, nor agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him in any manner. And if theſe Paſſions are oftimes attributed to him in the books of the Prophets, 'tis by way of ſimilitude with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:119039:226"/> mind, as well as repentance; or rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſimilitude which ſeems to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the actions us which men do out of choler, and thoſe which God does out of juſtice; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as both the one and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ther cauſe grief or pain to thoſe on whom they are exerciſed. 'Tis therefore the third ſort of ſatisfaction or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which is competent to God after ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar a manner, that the more perfect his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, it muſt of neceſſity be equally inexorable. And no man can imagine a juſtice in God capable of leaving the ſins of men unpuniſh'd, but he muſt with all fancy him little abhorring ſin, and too negligent of the natural order of things. Which would be a very unbefitting reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. But of this more at lage here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>But in the next place there is diſcover'd in the Goſpel an incomparably greater depth of Mercy. For it is evident, he obliges leſs by pardoning that conceives himſelf leſs offended, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf leſs offended that apprehends he may pardon without doing himſelf any injury, or diminiſhing the reputation of his virtue or his courage. On the contrary, he obliges more, that forgives an offenſe ſo ſenſible and atrocious, that to make expiation of it there needs a great preceding ſatisfaction. Since therefore the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion repreſents the juſtice of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable, and nevertheleſs tenders abſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to men by his mercy; of neceſſity this mercy muſt be of a more tranſcendent benignity, that ſwallows up an implacable fury. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his Wiſdom is admirably reſplendent in the
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:119039:227"/> Chriſtian Religion; whereas in the Jewiſh, as the Jews underſtand it, there is ſcarce a glimpſe of it in all that myſtery. For if he puniſh according to the curſe d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of man was unable to penetrate into, and wherein now it is revealed, appears an admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deſign of Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>And now what more natural concluſion can there be, then that the Chriſtian-Religion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more proper to induce men to Piety and Virtue, then the Jewiſh. For, as we have intimated elſewhere, there are three motives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that incite us thereunto; Fear of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Hope of Reward, and the Admiration of the excellence of the Nature of God in it ſelf, and of the beauty of piety and virtue in which his image is reſplendent. Now as for the Fear of puniſhment, it is always ſo much the greater as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſtice is vigorous and inflexible. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more implacable Religion repreſents the Juſtice of God, the more powerful is it to reclaim and keep men from vice by the terror of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In like maner, the Hope of reward ought to be greater, where Mercy is greater too. For our Conſcience bears us witneſs, that 'tis on this ſcore we are to expect it. And if Admiration of the Perfections which are in God can be to us an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious attractive to goodneſs (as indeed there
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:119039:227"/> is no true and ſincere Piety which is not princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally rooted and fixed on this foundation) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the great and incomprehenſible Wiſdom that is eminent in him, the immenſe depths of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ought to ingulf all our thoughts and inflame all the affections of our ſouls with a holy devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For ever ſince the time of the firſt ſin, all our piety is nothing but a gratitude towards his mercy. And laſtly, for that Contraries mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illuſtrate one another, the Beauty of Piety and Virtue will be more reſplendant by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Sin, the horror of which appears ſo much the greater, as the puniſhment that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it is more terrible. Now how much this conſideration, that God hath diſcharged the vengeance due to the ſins of men on the perſon of his own Son, exalts the luſtre of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent doctrine, we ſhall not now inſiſt upon (for we have not yet conſider'd the qualifications of his Perſon, who hath made this ſatisfaction for our offenſes) But truely every one may of himſelf readily judge.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Chriſtian Religion infinitely excels the Jewiſh, in the underſtanding of the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which concern the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> For what <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> is that which the Jews expect? A Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant King, who by force of arms may ſubdue the Nations, and bring Emperors under his yoak, and break Empires in pieces, may extend his conqueſts from Eaſt to Weſt, and from North to South, and fill the whole Earth with the terror of his Legions, and advance the Jewiſh Nation as high as it is now miſerably abaſed. For as for many more impertinences which they are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:119039:228"/> guilty of in this matter, I ſhall forbear to mention them; as leſs intending their ſhame then their conviction; And I cannot but pity them when I obſerve the race of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the people once beloved of the Lord, to equal and ſurpaſs in this all the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances of the Mahometans, and the Pagan fopperies. In that which I have propos'd which is the moſt tolerable of all their imaginations they ſufficiently manifeſt that they are of the fleſh and the world, ſince they apprehend nothing but carnal and mundane things. For if their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in them any ſpark of ſpiritual Light, they would acknowledge that they are compos'd of two Parts, Body and Soul; and that the body being earthly and material, and endued with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and faculties like to thoſe of beaſts, do's not come neer the dignity of the nature of the ſoul, which is ſpiritual, inmaterial, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, next the Nature of Angels, and as it were a beam of the very Deity. If therefore they expect glory and advantage from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> it ought to be chiefly in reference to the ſoul, and not for the body ſaving ſo far as it is the ſervant and dependant of the mind. Now, as we have ſhewn above, in what can the glory of the ſoul conſiſt, but in Wiſdom and Virtue? And wherein do's wiſdom lye, but in the knowledge of him, who is the Author and Fountain of all Virtue, Prudence and Underſtanding? Should he have turned the rocks into Diamonds, and the flints trampled on at each ſtep into Gold and Jewels, the Snow of the <hi>Alpes</hi> into Butter, and the rivers into milk,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:119039:228"/> the Wine of <hi>Judah</hi> into Nectar, and the bread of <hi>Aſher</hi> into Ambroſia, and driven all the Kings of the earth fetter'd before his triumphant Chariot into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet all this terrene pompe and magnificence had not been comparable to his lively illumination of minds by the knowledge of the Moſt-high, and to his victory over hearts, their paſſions and appetites. For there is ſo little proportion between the mind and the body, that the greateſt and moſt triumphant Emperor of the Earth, if vicious and ignorant of things worthy the excellence of man, is to be contemn'd in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the moſt miſerable ſlave that in the ſervile condition of his body, excells him as to the underſtanding in Virtue and Prudence. And I think there is not any ſo unworthy the being of man, that would not chooſe rather to looſe all the Kingdoms of the Earth, if he poſſeſs'd them, and after that even the limbes of his body, then the uſe of Reaſon which advances him above the equality of beaſts. Moreover, let them ſpeak in conſcience, whether it be not the ſenſe of their preſent calamitie and the miſerable eſtate they are reduc'd into by their diſperſion throughout the whole world, that makes them breath after a Deliverer powerful in arms. Now what is the cauſe of this miſery but their Sins, both ſuch as are common to all men in general, and particular to their own Nation? For certainly God who lov'd them ſo tenderly, and choſe them out from all others to communicate his Covenants to them, would not treat them ſo rigorouſly, were there not ſome lawful cauſe in their extraordinary offenſes.
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:119039:229"/> And what a ſtrange blindneſs and ſtupidity of mind is it, to have ſo quick a reſentment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, relating to the body, and not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the cauſe of them? What a depravity and perverſity of underſtanding, to groan under the ſtrokes of the hand of God, &amp; never to groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the load of their own iniquity? To pant inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly after a Deliverer of the Body, and never to think of the redemption of the ſoul? They are driven out of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and Heaven and Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound with their lamentations: They are by their ſins debar'd the hope of Heaven, and make no matter of it; They are inthralled to their corporeal enemies, and murmure againſt God for it; They themſelves are ſold to <hi>Satan</hi> and to Sin, and do not underſtand the horror of this ſervitude: They are impatient in a waiting the coming of ſome Perſon, that may reaſſemble them from their diſperſion, and deliver them in reference to the body: The Redeemer and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer of their fouls is offer'd and preach'd to them, and they reject him. They flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with hope of a profound and plenteous tranquillity in all ſorts of pleaſures and delights of the Fleſh, and cheer up themſelves with it: They are invited to taſte how good the Lord is in his compaſſions, and they refute it. Their thoughts are day and night upon gold, ſilver, ſilk, ſcarlet, fine linnen, and jewels; and their hearts leap with the fancy; The Goſpel tells them of riches and ornaments relating to the minde, and they blaſpheme it. Is this the Poſterity of that onely wife and intelligent people with whom God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſht his Covenants? But above all the reſt,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:119039:229"/> they do injury to the glory of that <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who was promiſed to them, to fancy him an earthly Prince. For ſince themſelves call his Kingdom the Kingdom of Heaven, what other ought they to hope for but one ſpiritual and heavenly; which beginning to be exercis'd here below in the ſouls of men which are of a ſpiritual nature, is accompliſh'd above in glory unſpeakable. And truly 'tis to this that all the Prophets lead us from the firſt to the laſt. What does that promiſe refer to <hi>(The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head)</hi> but to the conſolation of man by the hope of being deliver'd from the Curſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Death, into which he is fallen by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Evil One? For as he ſin'd principally with his ſoul, which is the ſource and principle of the actions of the body, and alone capable of underſtanding the laws of piety and obedience; ſo it was conſentaneous that the condemnation of death ſhould be directed to the ſoul in caſe of rebellion. And that other promiſe <hi>(In thy ſeed ſhall all the families of the Earth be bleſſed)</hi> and <hi>(I will give this Land to thee and to thy Poſterity after thee)</hi> wherein did it profit <hi>Abraham,</hi> if it aim'd no further then that <hi>Canaan,</hi> which himſelf never poſſeſs'd, and was not given to his Poſterity till above 400. years after? Was it either a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent conſolation to him in all the Croſſes that he underwent, or a Promiſe worthy of God who eſtabliſht his Covenant with him? For which of us cares what will be done a hundred years after his death? As for thoſe words of <hi>Jacob (untill Shiloh come)</hi> they promiſe a Prince of peace, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout whom neither fire nor ſword ſhall glitter,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:119039:230"/> but he ſhall be the author of peace between God and men. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah) that the Mountain of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountaines, and ſhall be exalted above the Hills, and all Nations ſhall flow unto it.</hi> But what to do? <hi>Come, ſhall they ſay, and let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths.</hi> Therefore 'tis to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd in the knowledge of the Name of the Lord, and not in Jewels or Pearls; to learn to moderate and ſubdue their Paſſions, and not to conquer Kingdomes. Alſo in the 25. chap. 6. <hi>verſ. In this mountain ſhall the Lord of hoſts make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all people a feaſt of fat things, a feaſt of Wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</hi> Can they take this according to the Letter? It is certain, there are ſome ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifi'd with the wine of ignorance, that they take it ſo, and expect to be ſatiated with that horrible Leviathan, which is powder'd up I know not where againſt the manifeſtation of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Poor people! who think the Prince of the Kingdom of Heaven will come to fill their bellies. But behold what follows, <hi>verſ. 7. And he will deſtroy in this mountain the face of the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt over all people, and the veil that is ſpread over all Nations.</hi> What is the meaning of this, but that all Nations being involv'd in ignorance as in the black veil of night, he will diſpell all that darkneſs to the end they may behold the light of his knowledge; that they may rejoyce (I ſay) in the light of that Sun of Righteouſneſs who carries healing in his wings? And thus through out all the Prophets; which would be
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:119039:230"/> too long to recite: there needs no more but to read them. For it will be found that he is a <hi>Prince of peace, upon whom the Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt, the Spirit of Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, the Spirit of counſel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.</hi> That under his reign, <hi>The Wolfe ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard lye down with the Kid; and the Calfe and the young Lyon and the fatling together, and a little child ſhall lead them,</hi> &amp;c. That is, He will unite the moſt hoſtile Nations together in the ſame ſociety of Religion, and cicurate and mollifie the fierceſt people by the knowledge of the true God, and render the moſt untractable natures gentle and ſweet. Which the Prophet himſelf expounds immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after; <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountain: For the earth ſhall be full of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea. He ſhall not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voice to be heard in the ſtreet. A bruiſed reed ſhall be not break, and the ſmoaking flaw ſhall he not quench.</hi> So far is it that he ſhall batter all to pieces with Canon-ſhot, or hew all down with the ſword. And as for his Glory, it muſt needs be other then ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial and corporeal, Since he was to be <hi>deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with grief:</hi> Since (I ſay) he was to be lowly, riding upon an Aſs &amp; a Colt the fole of an Aſs. And indeed the frail duſty ornaments of the Earth would have been too vile and wretched for him that is the Sun of righteouſneſs of ſouls. Wherefore foraſmuch as the Chriſtian Religion refers all the promiſes of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to the good
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:119039:231"/> of the Minde, making him to be the Redeemer of ſouls, and attributing to him a ſpiritual Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and glory; it directs them to their right end, from which the carnal imaginations of the Jews had perverted them, and hath conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as great pre-eminence above the Jewiſh in this point, as the ſoul hath above the body, and the Heavens above the Earth.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> That according to Right Reaſon and the Old Teſtament, the means of obtaining Salvation ought to be ſuch as the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion holds forth.</head>
               <p>I Affirmed in the precedent Chapter that the Law of God, and the nature of his juſtice require that either all men periſh univerſally, or that ſome perſon in their ſtead endure the puniſhment which they have merited. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is the Foundation of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the moſt uſual ſtumbling-ſtone on which the Jews and divers other people fall foul, it is requiſite for us to diſcover it ſomething more clearly in this Chapter. Certainly, if they will confeſs the truth, the natural terrors of their Conſciences, when they conſider the juſtice of God ſeriouſly, will make them acknowledge that nature it ſelf directs them in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of ſolid comfort, to ſeek out a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of merit proportionate to the Majeſty of him to whom it is due, and to the demerit of their offenſes. For not onely the Jews, to whom God revealed his vindictive juſtice more manifeſtly, but others who never heard ſpeak of the Law, have been invaded by them. Which how could it be, did not puniſhment accompany ſin as the ſhadow a body; and that for a man to be quit
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:119039:232"/> from the penalty, it muſt either be ſuffer'd by another, or he muſt be exempt from ſin himſelf? And the Natural Inſtinct which lead them to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſacrifices in the beginning, and which was approv'd and authoris'd by the Law of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament, is an evident argument of it. For whence was it that ſoon after ſin committed, <hi>Abel</hi> offers the firſt-lings of his ſtock in ſacrifice, and that this example became ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to all the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> that there ha's been no Nation by whom the death of beaſts immolated in ſacrifice was not practis'd; but onely that nature it ſelf taught him to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what he had deſerved, and all others have in like manner follow'd his ſentiments? So that though they could eaſily judge that the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not proportionate to the dignity of him with whom they thus tranſacted; yet being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able otherwiſe to ſatisfie, they offer'd that which they could, and withal referr'd it to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God to ſupply the reſt? Moreover it is apparent by ſeveral Nations mention'd above, and whoſe names and cuſtomes are recorded both in Holy &amp; Profane Hiſtories, as the <hi>Cananae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Tyrians, Carthaginians, Egyptians, Cyprians, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians, Perſians, Scythians, Cretans,</hi> the ancient <hi>Grecians,</hi> ancient <hi>Romans, Gauls,</hi> and others, who ſacrifis'd living men, that the opinion which <hi>Caeſar</hi> attributes to the <hi>Druydes,</hi> That it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the Wrath of the Gods to be appeas'd but by offering the blood of men to them, was naturally imprinted in their ſouls; Otherwiſe man, being ſufficiently prone to elevate the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his faults and flatter himſelf, partly
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:119039:232"/> through an immoderate ſelf-love, &amp; partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the little knowledge he hath of the nature of God, would never be ſo inhumanely animated againſt his own ſpecies, and even againſt his own children; which ſome of thoſe Nations were wont to make victimes of. And for teſtimony to this, I appeal to mens peculiar thoughts in the adminiſtration of humane juſtice. How do they deteſt murderers and robbers, and thoſe that give themſelves up to perpetrate heinous crimes? And when they obſerve a Magiſtrate ſuffering ſuch perſons to go on in impunity, do not they judge that he is either like them, one of their complices and partakers in their prey, or that he connives at their facinorous actions through want of power? Certainly, when any enormous miſdeed is committed, there ought no dammage to arrive to the Commonwealth either by the Fact or the example; But there is a kind of deteſtableneſs in the deed that of it ſelf cryes out for vengeance, the impunity of which blots the reputation of him who hath the authority and power of puniſhing in his hand, and brings him into an evil ſuſpition and eſteem. And he that ſhall more attentively conſider the emanations of his own minde, will finde that Nature ha's not onely indued us with the Paſſion of Anger to be inſervient towards defending us from particular injuries which are offered to us, but alſo ha's imprinted in our Minds a Hatred againſt Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes which do not particularly reach us, which cauſes us not to be ſatiſfied till we have ſeen vengeance inflicted upon the ſame. But aſſoon as we have beheld them
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:119039:233"/> expiated by ſutable puniſhment, our minds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the juſtice done with a kind of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and our indignation ceaſes. For cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt qualities and horrid vices in the ſoul, when they come to be diſcover'd by actions, they are like Ulcers and Cancers which hideouſly deform the viſage; we divert our thoughts from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with indignation, and our eyes from the latter with nauſeouſneſs. Now the Virtues which are but little in us, are in God in a degree tranſcendently eminent; he poſſeſſes (as we may ſpeak) the body of them, whereas we have no more then the ſhadow. As therefore a good Magiſtrate do's not onely deteſt Crimes, becauſe they are detrimental to the Commonwealth, but alſo by reaſon of the natural turpitude which renders Vice odious, were it not pernitious; ſo that he thinks he do's not ſatisfie the natural e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of things nor his own Conſcience unleſs he puniſh it; and the more upright a perſon the Judge is, the more hatred do's he bear againſt Vice for its own ſake: So God do's not onely puniſh Sin, being the Univerſal Judge and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of the World, becauſe it produces pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to Humane Society, and is an enemy to its preſervation; but alſo by reaſon of that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and eſſential deformity in it which is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Divine Nature and the natural order of things; ſo that he cannot poſſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with himſelf not to revenge it. And the more perfect his Nature is, the greater is this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deteſtation he hath againſt ſin.</p>
               <pb n="441" facs="tcp:119039:233"/>
               <p>But to proceed further; The Jews conſent that men are naturally corrupted by ſin, and that they have in them from their conception an evil ſeminary of Vice, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which (they ſay) is like a mountain to the Good, and a ſtraw to the Wicked; That is, they which are immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in it are not ſenſible of it, no more then a dead man would be of his burden, if he were buried under a mountain. But they in whom God hath put ſome ſparkle of ſpiritual life, feel what a great hinderance it is to their ſpiritual motions, and are diſcruciated and oppreſſed with it in their Conſciences. And we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd above that this Corruption is manifeſt in all, againſt thoſe which do not acknowledge the Holy Scriptures. Now, could the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice (in their opinion) allow that men ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to Eternal Felicity, without ſatisfaction beforehand and repentance of that natural corruption? No, ſurely. And they which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no Satisfaction, do yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it abſolutely neceſſary to the obtaining for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, and beatitude by that forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the ſinner repent of his Offenſes. I ask therefore, whence they have this repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Whether God begets it in them, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have it from themſelves? Certainly, the books of the Jews teach expreſly, that 'tis God who circumciſes the Heart. And the uſual prayers of <hi>David,</hi> That God would <hi>teach him to walk in the ways of his Commandments,</hi> ſufficiently ſhew, that if He, that was already conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and a man according to God's heart, ſtood in need of the Working of God in him
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:119039:234"/> that he might follow his ways aright, it follows that with greater reaſon it is neceſſary for God to work the converſion of ſinners, who are grown obdurate in their Wickedneſs. This, though it were not ſo plainly held forth in the Holy Books, is ſo evident, that even reaſon and experience make it good. For if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (who acknowledg'd not the vitioſity of mans Nature, but attributed all his depravedneſs to cuſtome) teaches that when a man ha's once contracted a habit of vice by cuſtome, it is not in his power afterwards to quit it, by reaſon that vice ha's poſſeſs'd his faculties, whoſe ſtrength and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is neceſſary to reſcue him from it, and hinders them from executing their natural abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; much more is it impoſſible for a man to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>implicate himſelf from ſin, the habit of which is in him, not by cuſtome onely, but alſo by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Cuſtome (it's ſaid) is another Nature; yet Nature is always ſtronger then cuſtome. How will it be then, when inveterate cuſtome and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are found together in the ſame vice? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, in ſuch caſe another force then humane is requiſite to reform it. Moreover, is not true repentance the Love of Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And is not that Love alſo the chief part of Beatitude, of which other things are but as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances? Surely, he that denies this, muſt paſs into the School of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who plac'd the Supreme Good of Man in Pleaſure, and made no reckoning of Virtue, but onely ſo far as it is requiſite to a cheerful and Pleaſant Life. Which was condemned by moſt part of the Pagans, and would be ſhameful for the Jews
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:119039:234"/> and thoſe who acknowledge their Books to be Divine, not to condemn. It will follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that without a foregoing ſatisfaction to his Juſtice, God may give the Wicked the principal part of Beatitude without Repentance. For ſince 'tis he that gives them to be penitent, and that the principal part of Felicity lyes in Repentance, that is, in the love of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and holineſs, God ſhall give them the principal part of beatitude before he ſees any preceding repentance in them. Now if there be nothing in the Nature of God which hinders him from giving the moſt excellent part of the Supreme Good to the Wicked without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to repentance, why ſhould there be ought in it to hinder him that he ſhould not even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that give them the other part of it, which conſiſts only in appendances, to wit, Immortality and Glory? Which yet themſelves account a thing abſurd and impoſſible. Nor would it be material here to ſay, that it is not poſſible that God ſhould give this Second and leſs principal part of Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, unles man have the former before, becauſe Happineſs is a natural conſequent of Virtue; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that there is ſuch a correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, that virtue is incompatible with Miſery, and Happineſs with Vice; and that they are things of ſo repugnant an eſſence, that there is no poſſibility of coupling them, but there will appear a remarkable diſſonance in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. And laſtly, that God may draw neer to a ſinful Creature to amend it, inaſmuch as he loves virtue in which the amendment of it conſiſts for its own ſake; but cannot have any communion
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:119039:235"/> with a wicked creature to render it happy, by reaſon the Happineſs of a creature is not ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious with God, that to confer it, he ſhould do injury to his juſtice and his Wiſdom, which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors vice and wickedneſs. For in the firſt place, if Happineſs accompanies Virtue by a natural and inſeparable dependance, miſery does not leſs neceſſarily attend vice and wickedneſs. So that if it be not poſſible for Virtue not to be remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated with a ſutable Happineſs, it is not leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Vice not to be puniſht with due chaſtiſement, there being an equal neceſſity and dependance between theſe things. And truely, he that conſiders the matter attentively, will finde that the bond which conjoyns Beatitude and Virtue together, is leſs indiſſoluble then that which connects Vice and Puniſhment. For the condition of the Creature being ſuch, that it ought to be holy and virtuous, though God had not commanded it; and that God having ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, it is bound to obey his command, though he had not propoſed the hope of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, inaſmuch as it owes all to God, both in regard of the infinite eminence of his Majeſty, and becauſe it holds its being from him; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which God makes of remuneration, and the actual retribution which he performs of the ſame, ought to be imputed onely to his goodneſs and gratuitous liberality. We cannot pretend any other right towards him, from whom we hold all, yea our very Being. Now that which proceeds from Goodneſs, ſeems not to be of ſo ſtrait an obligation, but that he which does it is at his liberty not to do it, and eſpecially when
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:119039:235"/> the tranſaction is between two perſons, the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and authority of one of which is infinitely above the condition of the other. Hence it is evident how, regard being had to the ſoverain Majeſty of God, which advances him infinitely above all his creatures, and exempts him from all obligation towards them, he might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Holineſs &amp; Virtue to his creatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out promiſing Recompenſe for it. But the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is between Puniſhment and Sin, as to the conſequence and dependance one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a relation of Juſtice, from the exerciſe of which it is ſo impoſſible for the Supreme and Infinite Dignity to be exempt, that the greater it is, the more is it oblig'd thereunto; for that, as I ſaid, the Love of Juſtice, on which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe depends, and the Hatred of Evil is a Perfection in God, inaſmuch as he is ſupreme governor and magiſtrate of the Univerſe; whence the greater his dignity is in this reſpect, the more is he oblig'd to the exerciſe of Juſtice, in which if he ſhould fail, it could not be but he muſt ſuffer diminution of his glory. Again, if there be ſuch a correſpondence between Virtue and Beatitude, that they cannot be diſſever'd, without appearance of deformity and irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo that the Wiſdom of God, who does all according to weight, number and meaſure, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not permit the diſ-junction of two things ſo cloſely united together; there is not leſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſin and puniſhment. Of which the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our minds, which are as obſcure ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the Properties which are in God, may be teſtimonies to our ſelves. For if we have
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:119039:236"/> compaſſion of a miſerable man, whom we eſteem not deſerving his miſery, we are alſo mov'd with indignation againſt one that is highly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, but unworthy the felicity he injoyes. And if we obſerve an excellent harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two things conjoin'd together, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Felicity; ſo likewiſe we eſteem theſe two extremely well adapted where we finde them together, Vice and Miſery. So it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous to the ſame Wiſdom of God who committs no diſſonance in any of his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to permit a ſeparation of theſe moſt Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Relatives. To conclude, I readily concede that God loves the virtue and holineſs of his creatures by reaſon of its own excellence; for how can he but love his own image? and alſo that it is more precious to him then the Felicity, conſequent to it; that is, to ſpeak more clearly, that it is more well-pleaſing to him that his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be holy and virtuous, then that it be happy. But at the ſame rate that goodneſs and piety are affected by him, he deteſts the creature that deſpiſes them. And if God be naturally inclin'd to provide for the happineſs of man, becauſe he is his Creator, he is likewiſe natural inclin'd to execute vengeance upon his Sin, inaſmuch as he is his Judge. And truely I wonder how any can ſo much cry up the Mercy of God in the impunity of ſins, to the prejudice of his Juſtice, whereas Hiſtorians do ſo highly extoll the memory of <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> for an act of juſtice done, as it may ſeem very much to the injury of the virtues of clemency and Mercy. This man (ſaith <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi>) having conſtituted very
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:119039:236"/> wholſome Laws in the City of the <hi>Locrians,</hi> one of which condemn'd adulterers to have their eyes pull'd out, it hapned that his own ſon was found guilty of the prohibited Crime, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obnoxious to the ſeverity of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment attending it. But the whole City interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the favour of the young man that he might be exempted from the rigor of the Law, were a long time denyed, till at length <hi>Zaleucus</hi> being overcome by the Petitions of his Citizens, that he might preſerve the ſight of his Son and the authority of his Laws, caus'd one of his own eyes to be pull'd out and one of his Sons; thus by an admirable temperament of equity ſhewing himſelf both a juſt Legiſlator and a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Father. Why did not he ſuffer his Law to ly dormant for one day, to ſave both the eyes of his Son for the good of the Commonwealth? Or if he would not that his Law ſhould be wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed, why did he puniſh himſelf, when he was no partaker in the fault? But his reaſon was, that having eſtabliſht Laws, he accounted them inviolable; and this Act is recorded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the moſt memorable examples of Juſtice. How then can any eſteem the eternal laws of God poſſible to be violated with impunity? Therefore either it is impoſſible for men to attain to the injoyment of Felicity without ſatisfying the Juſtice of God; or elſe it is poſſible for them to attain to it without Repentance. Which the common ſenſe of man abhors.</p>
               <p>Object. But poſſibly ſome may object and ask us, <hi>Whether the ſame abſurdity will not follow from the Chriſtian Doctrine which teaches neceſſity of a
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:119039:237"/> ſatisfaction precedaneous to Beatitude? For it informs us that men have not made ſatisfaction in their own perſons but in the perſon of another, who was conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Pledge in their room; and 'tis God himſelf that gave them this Pledge. Now the beſtowing one to make ſatisfaction for ſins, is an effect of infinite mercy and ineſtimable bounty; and yet it was not prevented by the repentance of men, but on the contrary preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their repentance; For the gift of ſanctification, to which repentance pertains, is an effect of the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and a fruit of the merit of Chriſt. How then could God be mov'd to communicate ſo great a good to men without preceding repentance, or without ſomething elſe equivalent to a ſatisfaction? And if he could love his creatures ſo much, notwithſtanding his juſtice, as to give them one to make ſatisfaction for them, to the end they might be capable of repentance and beatitude, why could he not give them both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and beatitude too without that ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This deſerves to be further diſplay'd, that ſo the harmony which is between the parts of Chriſtian Religion may become more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous. Satisfaction is to be conſider'd in two reſpects; Firſt, as it is a puniſhment of ſin, and ſo 'tis an act of juſtice; Secondly, as it is a means to obtain remiſſion and impunity to thoſe for whom ſatisfaction is made; and in this reſpect, 'tis an act of Mercy. As for the firſt, ſeeing it was an exerciſing of the juſtice of God upon the ſins of men, there needed no other previous condition. The caſe ſtands thus. The Creature ſin'd, and the juſtice of the Creator takes Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon it. For the ſecond, diſtinction
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:119039:237"/> muſt be made between the Mercy by which God is inclin'd to render his creatures good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if nothing withhold him from it, and that whereby he really and <hi>de facto</hi> renders them good and happy. Not that theſe are two Mercies; for they are but one; but being conſidered in the firſt reſpect, the effect which it would produce is intercepted by ſome obſtacle; and conſidered in the ſecond, it is follow'd with the effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an expedient is found out to remove the impediment which ſtrain'd its efficacy. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome image of the former ſort of Mercy can be found in men, it reſembles the natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which <hi>Zaleucus</hi> had for his ſon, whoſe ſight without queſtion (had he had no other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations) he ardently wiſh'd might remain ſafe and perfect. His paternal compaſſions would lead him to this, but the ſacred authority of his Law obſtructed his deſires, and reſtrain'd his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclinations, that he ſhould not do injury to juſtice. Now in reference to the firſt ſort of Mercy, we grant that it may be in God towards his ſinful creatures without any previous ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or condition of repentance. But yet withal it does no injury to juſtice, becauſe it brings nothing to effect. The conſideration of the Law tranſgreſſed by the Creature intercepts it, ſo that man remains in his condemnation. For the other, which really and effectually confers repentance and conſequently beatitude, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ought of neceſſity to precede it, becauſe otherwiſe it would derogate from Juſtice, as the pity with <hi>Zaleucus</hi> us'd in ſparing one of his ſons eyes would have prejudic'd the authority of his
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:119039:238"/> Law, if he had not at the ſame time decreed to pull out one of his own. But Gods giving of his ſon to make ſatisfaction for us, ariſing from the former ſort of mercy, was not founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any preceding condition or ſatisfaction; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it would be requiſite to proceed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity, or recur to repentance. But the real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of ſanctity and bleſſedneſs which attends it, was grounded on foregoing ſatisfaction. Whence it appears that though God might give us a Pledge without being otherwiſe prevented by us, yet he could not remit our ſins and bring us to ſalvation without the intervention of that Pledge. And herein it is that on the one ſide his mercy is reſplendant in willing it, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Juſtice in hindring him, and his Wiſdom in ſatisfying the latter by ſuch an expedient, and giving free paſſage to the former.</p>
               <p>Now this without doubt ought to be ſufficient to men of not contentious ſpirits: And never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs here it is that the Boaſters of Humane Reaſon lift up themſelves. What ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (ſay they) is there to puniſh ſin in any other then the perſon delinquent? What juſtice to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute vengeance upon the juſt inſtead of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt? And what proportion between the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one Man and the Sins of all the world? To the two former of theſe exceptions we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give ſatisfaction in the remainder of this Chapter; The third ſhall be remitted to another. Firſt then, that ſeveral perſons may be involv'd in the penalty and yet not in the guilt of a crime, appears in the practiſe of Life and ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of humane Juſtice. For Children are
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:119039:238"/> puniſht for the ſins of their Parents; and the tainte of the crimes of the Children redounds back upon the Fathers. This is ſeen every day in Offenſes of Treaſon, where the deſign is more atrocious in it ſelf and pernicious to the Common wealth. God himſelf, as Magiſtrate ha's given us a Precedent of this acting. For the Theſt of <hi>Akan,</hi> who purloin'd forbidden goods, was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to his whole Family, and the Poſterity of <hi>Saul</hi> was hang'd for their Father's fault. And the ſin of <hi>David,</hi> who in a vanity and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſtrength, caus'd the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be numbred, was expiated with the death of ſeventy thouſand men. Which alſo ſeem'd not irrational in the judgement of the Pagans, who very frequently attribute the defeats of great battailes and the loſs of flouriſhing Armies either cut in pieces or deſtroy'd by mortality, to the fault of one ſingle man. For, the overthrow of <hi>Cannae,</hi> if we will receive their account, was occaſion'd by I know not what ſin of <hi>Ter. Varro</hi> againſt <hi>Juno;</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> ſent the Peſtilence into the Army of the <hi>Greeks</hi> for <hi>Agamemnons</hi> deſpiſing his Prieſt.

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:119039:239"/> it cannot ſeem more inconvenient that a tranſlation of puniſhment be made from one perſon to another. And indeed that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of puniſhment is in ſome ſort a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating part of it. As if the Criminal not being capable of all the puniſhment, others ſhould be aſſociated with him to bear a part of it. Now if a part may be transfer'd, and he diſcharg'd from ſo much, why may not the whole be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd over to another and ſo he obtain abſolute exemption and impunity? Certainly, if it be not (as they ſpeak) of the eſſence of puniſhment for ſin to be all undergone by him that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, it will be no more eſſential to it, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone by him in part; provided at leaſt there be ſome ſufficient reaſon to oblige him that ſuffers the puniſhment to ſubſtitute himſelf in the place of him that deſerv'd it. And this reaſon ought not to be fetcht elſewhere then from the ſtrait and indiſſoluble conjunction that thoſe two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Criminal and the Sufferer have toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now there are divers ſorts of Tyes, which conjoyn perſons cloſely. Firſt, Natural Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity; as of Fathers towards their Children and Children towards their Fathers, of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren amongſt themſelves, and of all thoſe who have ſome neer communion in the ſame blood. Secondly, Political Union; as of Subjects with their Kings, <hi>&amp; viciſſim,</hi> and of fellow-Citizens one towards another. And thirdly, Friendſhip voluntarily contracted, but ratify'd by invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable promiſes of running (as they ſpeak) the ſame fortune, and laying down the life couragiouſly one for another. For it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> never lookt upon
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:119039:239"/> as unjuſt or ſtrange, for thoſe who are obſtring'd one to another by theſe bonds to partake in the puniſhment of their Relatives, or ſubſtituted themſelves in the room of one another to bear it all. There is nothing ſo celebrated in the Poets and Hiſtorians as the death which <hi>Alceſtis</hi> ſuffer'd in her huſbands ſtead, and the ſtory of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias</hi> Pythagorean Philoſophers of which one generouſly offer'd himſelf to bear the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death given againſt his Friend by <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> And many other like examples have been diligently collected by learned Men. What can be ſaid then, where there is found One that hath not onely one or two of theſe relations with mankind, but all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and much more? What injuſtice or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity will there be for him to derive the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mens ſins upon his own Perſon? But ſuch is He whom the Chriſtians venerate for their Redeemer. For he is man, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the ſame blood with them, one with them in communion of the ſame nature. He loves them ardently, hath contracted an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble ſociety with them, and hath offered himſelf of his own free and immutable will to be ſurety for their debts. He is King of all thoſe whom he hath redeemed, and their head, and their brother. But he was innocent, and they unrighteous. What equity can there be in this, that he who did nothing ſhould be beaten, and he that committed the fault have never a ſtripe? This is the Second Exception, to which there are three Anſwers. The Firſt of which is, that by demonſtrating above that Puniſhment may be
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:119039:240"/> communicated, and likewiſe all of it trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to the perſon of him that had no hand in the Crime, it was by the ſame means demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that the Juſt may be puniſh'd for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt: for he that was unconcern'd in the fault, of which notwithſtanding he ſuffers the penalty, is innocent in this reſpect, whether he be culpable or no in ſome other matters; and therefore he ſuffers in ſuch caſe, not for other matters of which he may be guilty, but in conſideration of this in reſpect of which he is abſolutely juſt. So that all his other actions what ever they be are ſet aſide, and of this, he is puniſh'd for, he is as innocent as the moſt virtuous man in the world. The Second is, that the Puniſhment of the Innocent and Impunity of the Guilty are ſo far from giving us ground to judge the Doctrine of ſatisfaction to the Divine Juſtice extravagant, that on the contrary 'tis that alone which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it receivable by right Reaſon. For had the ſubſtitute himſelf been culpable, he had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be a ſubſtitute, for that the Divine Law obliges the Creature to all it is able to perform, and therefore the Tranſgreſſion of it obliges to all the puniſhment of which the Creature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. If therefore the ſubſtitute ſhould be of himſelf obnoxious to puniſhment, how could he be able to ſatisfie for another? Certainly, he could not pay for an other, if he were bound to pay all he had of value in the world for himſelf. For he that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th but a hundred Crowns and can have no more, and owes them all, he can by no Arithmetic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tisfie for himſelf and his friend that owes a hundred more. Moreover, if they
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:119039:240"/> in whoſe ſtead the ſubſtitute ſuffered were ſtill ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to puniſhment, there would be no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which was purpoſely made to exempt them from it; Unprofitable were the payment made by the Surety, ſhould the Creditor have yet a right to redemand his debt. The Third Anſwer is, That if the Subſtitute had continued for ever under the condemnation of thoſe whoſe <hi>vicarius</hi> he became, ſuch an exceſſive charity might have been thought ſtrange, to deſtroy himſelf eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally for the ſalvation of others; But if he free himſelf from that condemnation, and bearing in his hand the diſcharge for an other, ſo wraſtle againſt the Curſe as to ſurmount it; if he indures the wrath of God even ſo far as to exhauſt it, if he fight ſo ſucceſsfully againſt Death as to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over it; if his very ſufferings are to him but a paſſage to ineſtimable glories; if he obtain for the priſe of his Fightings, beſide the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, an immortal Crown of honor and a tranſcendent Soverainty in Heaven and Earth, who can afterwards be ſcandalis'd at his ſufferings? And who will not acknowledge in his being willing to undergo the puniſhment deſerv'd by men, an immenſe charity; in his remaining victorious, a wonderful power; in his being ſo highly recompenſed, an immaculate juſtice; and in all this diſpenſation, an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Wiſdom? But ſuch is the Redeemer whom the Chriſtians have embraced, and whom they perſwade the Jews to acknowledge, even by inducements out of their own Scriptures. For beſides that, as was ſhewn above, all their ſacrifices were inept and unprofitable, if they
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:119039:241"/> had no figurative relation to ſome other really propitiatory ſacrifice, where the puniſhment of men's ſins were actually laid upon the victime offered, as it was typically plac'd upon the Beaſt which was immolated in the Tabernacle, ſo to reſcue really from eternal condemnation, as the other deliver'd typically from the legal maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The 53. chap. of the Propheſies <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is ſo expreſs to this purpoſe, that there muſt be abundance of perverſity to call it into doubt. For in the beginning he deſcribes the external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> (for 'tis of him he ſpeaks, as the moſt ſolid and learned among themſelves conſeſs) when he prepares himſelf for this ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſo full of ſorrows and griefs. <hi>He is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>grown up as a tender plant before him, and as a root out of a dry ground;</hi> that is, withered, and not like young plants which abound with ſap: <hi>He hath no form nor comlineſs, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not meet for him who prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for an ignominious death to lead before a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful and pompous Life. Being to deſcend ſo low, it was expedient to go by degrees, and not to fall down ſuddenly, as from a precipice. <hi>He is the deſpiſed and rejected amongſt men, a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was ſo deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not.</hi> Such ſcandal indeed, it behov'd him to ſuffer who was expoſed to all, that even his own ſhould abandon him, and be aſham'd of his ignominy: otherwiſe how could he have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us from the eternal reproach which we had deſerv'd, if himſelf had not been cover'd with

But as for the Victory he was to obtain over his enemies, the reſt he was to have after his labors, and the glory ariſing from his ſufferings, they are not leſs apparently held forth in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſions. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief. But when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days.</hi> Which, being he laid down his ſoul, can be onely by a victorious reſurrection. <hi>And the good pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi> Whence, God ſhall commit to him the execution of his decrees, and ſtrengthen him with power for the conduct of his purpoſes. <hi>He ſhall ſee the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied:</hi> for there is nothing of ſo delectable a guſt as the fruit of one's victories. <hi>By the knowledge of him ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many; for he ſhall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the ſpoil with the ſtrong, becauſe he hath powred out his ſoul unto death; and he was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with Tranſgreſſors, and bare the ſins of many, and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors.</hi> In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience now, is this to be a Prophet, or to preach our Goſpel? Is this to foretell things to come, or to point with the finger to things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or to relate paſs'd. Certainly, let any man chooſe the cleareſt paſſage of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament concerning this matter, and compare it with theſe recited, and it will be hard to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh which is that of the Apoſtle and which of the Prophet. We conclude therefore, that the Holy Scriptures of the Jews agree with the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:119039:242"/> Doctrine of ſatisfaction and have foretold it; and that Right Reaſon induces yea inforces to believe it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> That the Promiſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> ought to be both God and Man; whence it follows that there are ſeveral perſons in one ſimple Divine Eſſence: Alſo, Of the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Old Teſtament.</head>
               <p>THe third Objection againſt Satisfaction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be diſſolv'd; Namely, that the puniſhment of one alone is not ſufficient to obtain impunity for all men. Indeed, there is either no ſatisfaction, or it ought to be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate both to the oſſenſes of men for whom it was made, and the Juſtice of God that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed, and conſequently muſt be of an infinite worth and value. For to fancy to our ſelves a ſatisfaction admitted by God, infinitely below the demerit of the offenſe by way of <hi>Acceptance</hi> (as they ſpeak) that is, that he ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented as fully paid for all, though he receives but a ſmall part, is a thing not conſiſtent either with the Wiſdom or Goodneſs of God, or the nature of his Juſtice, as we declar'd it above. Not with his Juſtice; For ſince it is impoſſible for that to leave the ſins of men unpuniſht, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:119039:243"/> it is the Hatred and Deteſtation of Evil, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which is not divine if it be not infinite &amp; extreme, nor extreme &amp; infinite if it be not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inexorable; how could it be contented with the puniſhment of one alone, for a ſatisfaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to all mankind? ſeeing it ſhould thereby take vengance only for the offenſe of one, &amp; remit the ſin of all others freely without puniſhment? For, to ſpeak properly, there is no real ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in an Acceptance, but onely for ſo much as is receiv'd; all the remainder of the debt exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is receiv'd is freely forgiven, and there is none but a fictitious and imaginary ſatisfaction for it. Now it is not competent to an implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble juſtice to be pay'd with empty formalities and fictions. Secondly, not with his Goodneſs. For it there be nothing in his Nature that hinders him from remitting gratuitouſly and without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction the offenſes of all men, ſaving one, what can there be in it to hinder him from forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that one alſo? If, I ſay, there be nothing to hinder him from being contented with the death of one ſingle man onely (which of it ſelf is of value onely to be ſatisfactory for one) for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the infinite offenſes of an almoſt infinite number of men, why did he not likewiſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe this his infinite goodneſs towards this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſo it might be complete, and no ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance eclipſe its luſtre? Since alſo, be it by Acceptance or no, it is perpetually neceſſary that the perſon who is to make the ſatisfaction be perfectly innocent and exempt from ſin. For God would not accept a polluted victime; and he were uncapable of appeaſing the wrath of
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:119039:243"/> God for another who had provoked him by his own offenſe. Whence it ſhould ſeem, he could ſcarce juſtifie his Goodneſs, if freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning ſinners, he ſhould without any need at all revenge himſelf upon an innocent perſon. Laſtly, 'tis not conſiſtent with his Wiſdom. For to what end were it to, make ſuch an ambages and intricacy, where the way is ſo plain and ſhort? What could be more eaſie then to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don plainly without digreſſing to a ſatisfaction wholly defective in it ſelf, and complete onely becauſe he that receives it will abſolutely have his juſtice contented with it? The reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, is, that he might ſhew that his juſtice is terrible when he pleaſes, and ingenerate in the minds of mortals ſo much greater horror of their offenſes. Certainly, if the deſign be to render Divine Juſtice ſormidable, it appear'd ſo incomparably more in <hi>Noah's</hi> Flood, the confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and many other dreadful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then in the Death of one ſingle man. And if men muſt be made to know how worthy their Sin is of deteſtation and Hatred, the Deſtruction of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with the unparallel'd mortality and ſlaughter that was ſeen there is a much more authentick Document to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and an Inſtance that ſpeaks lowder and farther beyond compariſon. But I believe men are not poſſeſs'd with much dread of the wrath of God, when they are preach'd to, that it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed with ſo ſmall a matter. It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſarily that the Satisfaction be of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite weight and value, to the end it may be proportionate to the ſin of men and to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:119039:244"/> Majeſty of God himſelf. But who can make it ſuch? No man ſurely, who is nothing more then man. For the condition of his Nature is too low, and the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>unds of his dignity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence too narrow, to correſpond to ſo great an effect. It would be very much if One could pay for one; beſides that the ſurety muſt abide in eternal deſtruction and having ſav'd an other periſh himſelf for ever. Then, all men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cannot make it. For ſince Sin committed againſt an infinite Majeſty deſerves an infinite puniſhment, the Offenſe increaſing, as Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Juriſts teach, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of his dignity againſt whom it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and ſince the puniſhment of men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be infinite unleſs it be eternal; ſhould all men in general preſent themſelves to undergo the wrath of God, they would become over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd by it to all eternity, far from redeeming themſelves by a ſufficient ſatisfaction. Thirdly, the Angels are equally unable. For beſides that there is not communion and affinity enough between men and them, to be conveniently ſubſtituted as Pledges for them in ſuffering thoſe pains, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever dignity the Angelical Nature poſſeſſes, whatſoever excellence it may have above the humane, yet it could never ariſe to equal the Majeſty of God, in order to ſatisfying his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice after a proportional manner. For at moſt they are but Creatures, and there is an immenſe diſproportion between the Creature and the Creator. And he had good reaſon, who ſaid, Behold, <hi>He putteth no truſt in his ſervants, and his Angels he chargeth with folly.</hi> Becauſe, though
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:119039:244"/> upon compariſon of Angels with men, they are of more tranſcendent purity and excellence; yet if they be compar'd with God, all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence is deſpicable; and were it not that God upholds them they would fall; did not he infuſe Light into them they would become darkneſs, as well as we. There remains therefore but one Expedient; which is, for God who alone is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, to ſatisfie himſelf. And here it is that humane Reaſon is confounded. Let us, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, experience how far we are able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this abyſſe.</p>
               <p>By the words above recited out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> it appears that he <hi>that underwent the chaſtiſement of our peace,</hi> was to be man. <hi>A man of ſorrows</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and acquainted with grief, who muſt lay down his ſoul an offering for ſin:</hi> and this cannot be meant of any other Creature. But had he had not expreſs'd the ſame ſo manifeſtly, the nature of the puniſhment which it behov'd him to ſuffer, neceſſarily requires it. For this is the wages of ſin, <hi>In the day thou eateſt of the fruit of this Tree, thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> that is, thou ſhalt be under the ſubjection and condemnation of death both as to body and ſoul. For as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Piety ha's reſpect to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete man, compos'd of body and ſoul, ſo alſo ha's the retribution of ſin, which ha's corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both the one and the other. And indeed, he that was to <hi>break the Serpents head,</hi> according to the word of God, <hi>was</hi> to be the ſeed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. If therefore the ſatisfaction which he was to render to God, ought to be of an infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, what perſon is able to render it, though a
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:119039:245"/> man, unleſs himſelf be of an infinite dignity? And if ſuch man be of an infinite dignity, what remains but that he is alſo God; ſince infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of dignity cannot reſide but in the divine Eſſence and Nature? Certainly, infiniteneſs of Dignity is as much incommunicable as infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Eſſence; for it ha's its root and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in infiniteneſs of Eſſence, and the one is as the natural reflexion or irradiation of the other. So that, as it is impoſſible to ſeparate the light and ſtrength of the Sun from the Sun it ſelf, or to imagine that ſomething ſhould poſſeſs that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſplendor and vivificant virtue which is in the Sun, and not fancy it to be the Sun it ſelf; So, yea, much more, impoſſible is it, to attribute a dignity beyond all limits to any whatſoever, and not withall attribute to him an uncircumſcrib'd and infinite eſſence. And to this, how ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant ſoever to their reaſon, do the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Scriptures manifeſtly aſtipulate, out of which, I ſhall for brevity's ſake, produce but ſome few irrefragable paſſages. Thus ſpeaks the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> in the 3. chap. of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. <hi>Behold, I will ſend my meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the may before me: and the Lord whom ye ſeek, ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple; even the meſſenger of the Covenant whom ye delight in.</hi> Words which we have ſhewn above, and the Jews grant, are intended of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> alone; the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who alone was promis'd to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to his Church. Now, I beſeech you, to whom was the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> dedicated but to the true God? and can it then be meant of any ſimply a Creature that it was his Temple? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:119039:245"/> neither the Jealouſie of the Lord could endure it, nor the ancient piety of the Jews have permitted it; the erection of Temples, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Altars being not due but to the Deity alone, as teſtimonies of the ſoverain honor we owe to his ſupreme nature and Majeſty. But <hi>David</hi> apertly terms him God in the 45. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and will not have us put to the neceſſity of gathering it by conſequence. <hi>Thy throne</hi> (O GOD) <hi>is for ever and ever; The ſcepter of thy kingdom is a right ſcepter. Thou loveſt righteouſneſs and hateſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; therefore, O God, thy God hath annointed thee with the oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows.</hi> For I challenge any man, to make out to whom elſe theſe words can ſute, but to the <hi>Meſſias?</hi> Whoſe throne is this that muſt abide for ever and to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? For that the words he uſes, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſignifie a duration without end, they know who underſtand any thing in this language. Now there is no appearance, that the Holy Spirit would give the name of God to a ſimple creature on this manner, together with a Kingdom of everlaſting duration. So likewiſe in the 110. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where <hi>David</hi> calls the <hi>Meſſias his Lord,</hi> ther's no queſtion but he would have him underſtood to be ſomething more beſides a meer man. For <hi>David</hi> was a King and depended of no other but God; ſo that between the Divine Power and that which is truely Regal, ſuch as that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was, there can be no other intermediate. And yet he ſtiles him with the ſame appellation ſubjects uſe to their ſoverain Prince. In the 110. <hi>Pſalm; The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footſtool.</hi>
                  <pb n="466" facs="tcp:119039:246"/> But leaſt any further cavill at this word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>The Prince of Peace.</hi> Are theſe titles competent to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? I know well that they aſſay to turn this paſſage to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and refer all theſe titles to God, except that of the Prince of Peace, which they ſay is given by him to <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> but it behoveth to have loſt both ſhame and the uſe of common ſenſe to believe them. For in what other place of the Scripture, where the Prophets mean to ſpeak of God, and ſome action pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by him to be done, do they accumulate ſo many titles? Beſides, that to them that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, the genius of the language contradicts them very evidently: and their beſt Paraphraſts, being overcome with the clearneſs of the truth, refer it to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> But the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks with the greateſt clearneſs poſſible, in the 23. <hi>chap.</hi> of his Prophecy, <hi>Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto David a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Branch, and he ſhall raign as King, and ſhall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgement and juſtice in the Earth. In his days Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely; and this is his Name whereby he ſhall be called, THE
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:119039:246"/> LORD O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R RIGHTEO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SNESSE,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For here the Ineffable name of God is us'd, which is as much incommunicable, according to the opinion of the Jews themſelves, as his very eſſence. And indeed the greateſt part of his other Names ſeem to hold forth his Properties; but this denotes his eternally permanent eſſence. This is it by which he delights to call himſelf, and glorifies himſelf in it. 'Tis true, they have two exceptions againſt this. One, that it ought to be tranſlated thus; <hi>And the Name of him that ſhall call him, is the Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> The other, that the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is alſo termed by this Name, and therefore that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> cannot take ſo great advantage by it. But theſe are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils unworthy of people in whom there is left the leaſt meaſure of Underſtanding and Ingenuity. For as for the firſt; to what end here ſerves the mentioning the name of him that muſt call the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> without expreſſing the name of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> himſelf, ſeeing the drift is to ſet him forth, and to encourage the Church with the hope of thoſe benefits which ſhould accompany his coming into the World? And in the next place what a defective manner of ſpeaking is this, <hi>And the name of him that ſhall call him,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding <hi>how</hi> or <hi>wherefore?</hi> What example can be produc'd of the like? And when the Prophet ſpeaks thus; <hi>In thoſe days I will raiſe unto David a righteous branch,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In his dayes Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Jeruſalem ſhall dwell ſafely, and then ſhall ſhe be called The Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> where the name of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably declar'd, and not of him that calls
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:119039:247"/> her, is the phraſe and placing of the words whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alike? For the ſecond, Indeed it is more then evident, that this Name cannot have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to a Perſon and to a City after the ſame manner. To a Cit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it cannot be ſutable, but only as a memorial of Favour done to it by him to whom the Name is properly competent. And to a Perſon it cannot be appropriated, but to denote ſomthing that reſides in ſuch perſon. There can be no danger in communicating ſo glorious a Name to a City, none being ſo brutiſh or ſtupid as to take occaſion to ſuſpect any Divinity either in the whole people of a City, or its ſtones. To a man ſimply as man it cannot be given without an inevitable ſcandal of Idolatry, eſpecially to ſuch a perſonage as he that is deſcrib'd there was to be, not onely a King, but the firſt-born among Kings, and the King of the whole world. And truely, if the <hi>Meſſias</hi> be not God, it would be injuſtice to condemne thoſe that ſhould adore him, as culpable of Idolatry, ſeeing him honored with ſo magnificent Names. For what ought we not to render to him, to whom both divine names and honors are communicated in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the names of the higheſt Majeſty, as that of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the moſt ſublime honors, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of a Temple, and that ſo holy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a Temple? Beſides, that in deſcribing his admirable atchievements, there is excuſe more then enough for error; if error may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted herein. He ought <hi>to break the ſerpents head with his heel.</hi> Is it within the power of a meer man to foil ſo ſtrong an enemy with ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and glory? <hi>In him all the families of the earth
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:119039:247"/> ought to be bleſſed.</hi> A benediction ſo firm and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, that it reaches through ſo many Ages, and is diffus'd ſo abundantly over all Nations, whence could it flow but from an infinite foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? He ought <hi>to have the Heathen for his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</hi> Can ſo great an Empire be maintain'd and governed, yea even eternally, without an infinite power and wiſdom? He ought <hi>to ſit at the right hand of God.</hi> But how ſhould he be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſo great an honor except he be God himſelf? For ſeeing Kings did not readily admit any to ſit at their right hands, but onely thoſe which were of their own blood, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did <hi>Bathſhebah,</hi> or whom they eſtabliſh'd Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Governors of their Dominions, as being the ſecond place of the Kingdom, moſt honorable next the throne: Whether it be out of the firſt conſideration that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the right hand of God, he can have no conſanguinity with him but by communion of Nature; Or the Second, he cannot be capable of ſo eminent a dignity, nor provided of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power enough to maintain the ſame, it being neceſſary to poſſeſs both in an infinite manner, if the perſon himſelf be not infinite. He ought to redeem the Church both by ſuffering an infinite puniſhment, as we have ſhewn, and by the victory which he was to obtain over death and him that was chief in the Empire of death. Who could undertake and accompliſh ſo great a deſign, unleſs one that is very God? Now if this <hi>Meſſias</hi> our Surety, ought to be God, as muſt be acknowledg'd, or elſe all the Holy Scriptures
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:119039:248"/> denyed; foraſmuch as his Perſon is of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite dignity, his Satisfaction was not only ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all mankind (which how numerous ſoever, cannot be actually infinite) but alſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to the immenſity of the Nature of God, and proportionate to his Juſtice. For as the Profeſſors of the Civil Laws teach that crimes become more henious proportionably to the dignity of the perſon againſt whom they are committed, and Reaſon alſo adds its ſuffrage hereunto, ſo in like manner they atteſt that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties and Satisfactions are rated according to the dignity of thoſe who undergo and perform them. And it is not material, that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſerved by men was to be eternal in caſe they ſuffer'd it in their own perſons, whereas the Paſſion of their Subſtitute ought to have had a certain termination of time; otherwiſe (that which is impoſſible to imagine) a perſon of ſuch excellence ſhould have continued under perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual condemnation. For according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right and order of things, ſin deſerv'd an infinite puniſhment, inaſmuch as it was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt an infinite majeſty. But becauſe the nature of man is bounded, and infinity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be competent to him but onely by perpetual duration; had men themſelves been to ſuffer it, it could not have been infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe but onely by being eternal. But the ſatisfaction performed by our Subſtitute, did not need to be immenſe in reſpect of perpetual dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becauſe his perſon was of an infinite digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For it was made according to the abſolute Right of Gods Juſtice, and the Natural order of
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:119039:248"/> things, and not according to the compenſation which ſhould have been made in the perſons of men by the eternal duration of their paines, by reaſon of the narrow limitation of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>From this diſcourſe it very clearly reſults that there are diſtinctly in the Divine Eſſence, which with the Jews we acknowledge to be one and ſimple, at leaſt two Perſons, or Hypoſtaſes, or Subſiſtences; (for we ſtand not greatly upon it, by which of theſe names they are termed) Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which is moſt uſually repreſented to us in the Old Teſtament by the Name of God Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all things; and that, which in order to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mediator between God and Men was to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume humane Nature; who is ſometimes repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us under the names of <hi>SON</hi> and <hi>Branch.</hi> As in the 2 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the decree; The Lord hath ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>Kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry.</hi> For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever clouds they endeavor to obſcure this place with, it is as clear as the Noon-Sun, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be applyed to <hi>David</hi> or any other beſides the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> No other can inherit ſo glorious a name as to be called, The Son of God, nor have the uttermoſt parts of the Earth for his poſſeſſion and the Heathen for his inheritance. So likewiſe that that promiſe made unto <hi>David [When thy days be fulfilled, and thou ſhalt ſleep with thy Fathers, I will ſet up thy ſeed after thee, which ſhall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will eſtabliſh his Kingdom.

<pb n="472" facs="tcp:119039:249"/> and he ſhall be my Son]</hi> is applicable to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> (though that which follows agrees to him <hi>[But if he commit iniquity, &amp;c.)]</hi> the too great magnificence of the words and the event of things cannot allow: the Kingdom of <hi>Solomon</hi> having been firſt of all rent in two in the time of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and afterwards his Throne for ſo many Ages ſo ſhatter'd to pieces that there are not the leaſt reliques of it to be found in the world. And in another place, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given,</hi> &amp;c. Of whom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion <hi>Solomon</hi> is to be underſtood, where he introduces wiſdom ſpeaking thus; <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice. By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth. The Lord poſſeſſed me in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his way, before his works of old. I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning or ever the earth was made. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there was no fountaines abounding with water. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mountaines were ſetled, before the hills was I brought forth. When he prepared the Heavens, I was there; when he ſet a compaſs upon the face of the depth. Then was I by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, rejoycing always before him.</hi> For what a ſtrange manner of ſpeaking would this be if the intent were onely to expreſs that God is wiſe? To what purpoſe were it to give us notice ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, that he was wiſe from the beginning, if there be no other myſtery in it, ſeeing it is as impoſſible that he ſhould ever be without Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:119039:249"/> as his own Divine Nature? What maner of expreſſion is it of Gods being wiſe from all time, for wiſdom her ſelf to cry out the Lord begat her? Can any Poetical Fury excuſe ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and uncouth fetches, and eſpecially in a Book whoſe ſtyle otherwiſe throughout, though it ſeems writ in verſe, is as remote from enthuſiaſmes as the Heavens are from the Earth? Now the Son is without queſtion a Perſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Father; The Wiſdom begotten, from him which begets it; The Branch ſhouted forth from him that emits it; He that cauſes to ſit, from Him that ſits at the right hand. And reaſon conſequently proves the ſame evidently. For ſince it was requiſite ſatisfaction ſhould be made to that eternal and immutable Juſtice, and it behoved him to be God that ſhould make it, to whom could he ſatisfie unleſs there be an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon likewiſe God in whom this Juſtice is conſidered? For we have aſſerted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated many times, that this Juſtice is a Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in God, which conſiſts in the hatred of evil; and that God by puniſhing exerciſes the office of univerſall Magiſtrate and Judge of the World. Wherfore it was neceſſary for the perſon who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd this inexorable Juſtice to be diſtinct from him upon whom it was exercis'd, the puniſher from the ſufferer. For in one and the ſame matter and the ſame reſpect none can be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and Criminal both together.</p>
               <p>Well (will ſome ſay) let Chriſtian Religion ſtop there. The Scripture and Reaſon hold forth theſe two diſtinct Perſons. But Chriſtianity conjoines alſo a Third. What neceſſity is there
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:119039:250"/> of multiplying thus the Perſons of the Deity? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that which makes the Chriſtian Doctrine ſeem ſtrange in this point, is, that Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is not eaſily able to comprehend how divers perſons really and diſtinctly ſubſiſtent can reſide in one ſingle and ſimple eſſence: the union of eſſence being according to the judgement of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, repugnant thereunto. But if it be granted upon inducement of the Holy Scriptures and the neceſſary dependance of theſe truths ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently coherent together, that there are two diſtinct Perſons in one ſingle eſſence of God, the Doctrine of a Third ought not to be ſcrupul'd. For the Unity of the Divine Eſſence will be as little repugnant to the diſtinct ſubſiſtence of Three Perſons as of Two. It behoves us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to inquire in brief whether the Jews may finde this Third Perſon in their Books. Now mention is ſo frequently made of the Spirit of God in the Books of the Prophets, that it is ſome trouble to make choiſe in ſo great a multitude. Theſe are apparent amongſt others; <hi>I have not ſpoken in ſecret from the beginning</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah</hi> chap. 48.) <hi>and now the Lord God and his Spirit hath ſent me.</hi> Are not the Lord and his Spirit diſtinct? And yet to whom appertains it to ſend Prophets but to the Lord himſelf? If the Spirit had not been God, would <hi>Iſaiah</hi> have call'd himſelf his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet? And that it might not ſeem to be the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon who is call'd The Spirit, he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where puts all three diſtinctly in one and the ſame paſſage; <hi>And the Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the Spirit of Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel and Might,</hi> &amp;c. For it is clearer
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:119039:250"/> then the day, That the Branch growing out of the roots of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> is the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> upon whom ſeeing the Spirit of the Lord ought to reſt, and that He alſo, as we have ſhewn, is the Lord, behold here is one only Lord diſtinguiſh'd into three Perſons. And in another place in the ſame terms; <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me.</hi> What <hi>me?</hi> The Prophet? No. For it follows, <hi>Becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath ſent me to binde up the broken hearted, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound: To proclaim the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable yeer of the Lord.</hi> Effects which tranſcend both the capacity and the condition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets times. And to the ſame effect in another place; <hi>Behold my ſervant</hi> (to wit, the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſo ſtyled in reſpect of his humane nature, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as he is Mediator he is employed by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Redemption of the Church) <hi>whom I will uphold, mine Elect, in whom my Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth; I have put my Spirit upon him.</hi> And that paſſage in the 1 <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Geneſis</hi> is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, though they except againſt it; <hi>And the Earth was without form, and void; and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</hi> For what is that Spirit of the Lord? A great Wind (ſay they) which agitated that confuſed Maſs of the Elements; for <hi>great</hi> things are ſaid to be <hi>God's;</hi> as <hi>the Mountains of God.</hi> But in the firſt place, what veriſimilitude is there that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould in the beginning of his Hiſtory make uſe of a rare phraſe and which is not found but in the Books of the other Prophets, and perhaps no where
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:119039:251"/> elſe in his own; which is enough to evince that it was not yet extant in his time? In the next place, whence came this great Wind, and to what end ſerv'd it? Was it to hinder that great confus'd maſs from putrifying? God was well able to hinder that; and there being as yet no order eſtabliſht in Nature, it was not needful for God to create a wind ſupernaturally, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the putrifying of the Matter by its agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And Then, the Matter of the Chaos being to continue ſo little a ſpace in that eſtate, the putrifaction of it was not to be feared: Beſides, the word <hi>moved,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, does not ſignifie ſuch a motion as the blaſt of a great winde, but onely a gentle tremulous concuſſion, in which regard it is attributed to the Eagle's ſhaking the wings in incubation over its brood; as if <hi>Moſes</hi> would have ſaid, The Spirit of God gently incubated on the World to cauſe it to be excluded or brought forth out of that confuſed matter. But many others have handled this Doctrine at large, and therefore I ſhall produce no more teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Certainly, if regard be had to the Order which Chriſtian Religion obſerves, not ſo much in reference to theſe diſtinct perſons conſidered in themſelves (for they are abyſſes, which it looks upon as inſcrutable) as to the effects which are attributed to them in the work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind, it will be found highly admirable. For to the Father, as to the firſt Principal Author of all things, it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes the care and adminiſtration of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice which takes vengance on the Sins of
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:119039:251"/> men; So that 'tis properly to his Perſon as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendant of the Common right of the Three in what relates to the unity of their Eſſence, that ſatisfaction ha's been rendred; And the firſt ſource of that Mercy whereby he was moved to determine to raiſe man from the miſery into which he was fallen; And the Invention (if I may ſo ſpeak) of that Expedient in order to it by his incomprehenſible Wiſdom. To the Son, as to him who aſſum'd humane Nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd it with the Divine in the unity of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and who ſuffer'd in one of his Natures a Paſſion of infinite value by reaſon of the infinite dignity of his other, it attributes the work of Redemption both in regard of the ſatisfaction which he made and the exerciſe and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the other things belonging to his office. So all things having been created, as the Wiſe man ſpeaks, by that eternal Wiſdom, it could not be competent but to the ſame to raiſe them out of their ruins. To the Holy Spirit, as to him who, being common to the Father and the Son, is the Virtue by which both one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther produces things, and bring their purpoſes into being, it attributes the Action which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders both the mercies of the Father and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the Son beneficial and efficacious to us. For what would the Dilection of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage us if we do not experience it, and the ſatisfaction of the Son if we do not embrace and receive it, to the peace and joy of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? Which how can we do, if the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Underſtandings and Wills which are
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:119039:252"/> ſo blind and perverted, be not inlightned from above, and rectify'd by a ſupernatural power? So the Father, who prevented the exiſtence of all things by his goodneſs, hath alſo prevented them by his mercy in reſtoring them to a happy being. The Son, by whom all things were at firſt created, as by the Eternal Wiſdom and Word, hath re-eſtabliſh'd and repair'd them. And the Holy Spirit, by virtue of whom both the Father and the Son accompliſh'd the Decree of the Creation of the World, hath alſo been the Virtue of both to perfect actually the reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the World.</p>
               <p>Nor ought the Jews here to be exaſperated, or humane reaſon demur. For as for the Jews, ſince their own Scriptures teach this, what can they oppoſe in contradiction? Are they wont to control the words of the Lord, or to meaſure the Doctrine he reveals to them by their own judgements? Have they not learnt, <hi>That his thoughts are not as their thoughts; nor his wayes as their wayes, but as diſtant as the Heaven is high above the Earth?</hi> Have they not learn'd of their Prophet, that not onely <hi>none hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his Counſellor hath taught him,</hi> but alſo that there is no poſſibility of fadoming his underſtanding? Yet their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, who liv'd before the Hatred of Chriſtian Religion had ſo blinded their Nation, perceiv'd ſome ſhadows of theſe truths in the Scripture, and have left divers footſteps of them in their Commentaries and Paraphraſes, ſpeaking ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently both of the Word and the Wiſdom of God and of his ſpirit, as of things diſtinct, that
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:119039:252"/> there is but too much to convince the obſtinacy of their deſcendants. As for humane Reaſon, it ought not much to be ſcandalis'd if there be in the nature of God a depth beyond comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, there being in all other things which ſeem commenſurate to its capacity, ſo many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which check it. None ha's yet been found that could give account of that Motion in the Heavens called The Motion of <hi>Trepidation;</hi> yea 'tis not yet fully determin'd, if we follow the Phaenomena of Aſtronomers, whether the earth circulates about the Sun, or the Sun about the Earth. The formation of Meteors ha's not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been clearly and certainly explicated, nor is there any that pretends confidently to have diſcover'd their cauſes throughly. The Flux and Reflux of the ſea is to Philoſophers a ſecret more deep then any of its abyſſes; and there is no mention of any that ever rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it. Then, in terreſtrial things, who is he that can declare to us the nature of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, what that attractive virtue is which draws Iron to it, and that other of it's verticity towards the Poles of the World? How nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous myſteries are there in the moſt eaſie Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which cannot be diſcover'd to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome; and how many things ſeem facil, againſt which the acies of our minds is blunted? Who ever underſtood the reaſons of the almoſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite variations, which are obſerv'd in the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Elements in the production of all things, as to colour, figure, quality, quantity, medicinal and venemous faculties? All the world knows what a Circle is, and Children are
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:119039:253"/> not ignorant of the ſhape a Square, a Peaſant is capable of comprehending that there is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all appearance ſome proportion between theſe two figures; and yet after ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years to the preſent time, it is not found out nor determin'd what it may be. Where is the perſon amongſt us, that is able to make our handſomely what is meant by the Agent and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Intellect, as they ſpeak, and wherein their difference conſiſts? And 1. evertheleſs they bick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Scholes to maintain that they are really diſtinct. Certainly, nothing ought to be ſo well known to us as our ſelves, nothing ſo evident to our minds as their own motions. Now we underſtand and <hi>will</hi> different things a thouſand times in one day; and yet 'tis diſputed whether the Will neceſſarily follows the dictates of the Underſtanding, or have ſome liberty of reſiſtance for all dominion it ha's over it. 'Tis ſcarce known whether they be two diſtinct Faculties, and there are ſome which confound them. Books are compil'd of the Miracles of Nature; ſo term'd, becauſe the effects indeed are viſible, but the cauſes undiſcern'd. The Occult Sympathies and Antipathies of things fill complete Volumes; and after the moſt exact and curious Enquiries, Obſcurity and Incomprehenſion is pleaded in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of Ignorance. Phyſitians examine our Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes every day, and the moſt learned amongſt them, if ingenuous, confeſs they underſtand not what that wonderful facultie is which ſets the Heart in motion, whether it began to move firſt by contracting or dilating it ſelf, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Arteries are contracted at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:119039:253"/> of the Hearts extenſion. What ground of ſcandal therefore is in this aſſertion, that there is ſomething in the Nature of God which we are not able to comprehend? But which is more; ſhould it be granted that there is but one ſingle perſon in the Divine Eſſence, yet none can boaſt of being able to ſolve the difficulties which may arrive from thence. For what humane mind is capable of diſtinctly underſtanding how all the Perfections of God are his very Eſſence, and not Accidents or Qualities like thoſe faculties of ours, really diſtinct from the ſubject in which they reſide? Since there are ſome of them not onely extremely different; as Wiſdom and Power, but directly oppoſite, as Juſtice and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? And yet reaſon induces yea compells to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; otherwiſe, Accidents muſt be imagin'd in God, and conſequently a compoſition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the ſimplicity of his being. Who is he of us that is able to imagine an infinite eſſence, as the Divine is, diffus'd infinitely in the mane ſpace, beyond the world, expanded throughout the whole Univerſe, ſo as to be totally preſent in all things, not divided or ſeparated by the occurſe and interpoſition of bodies, not mingled and confounded with the ſpiritual and immaterial ſubſtance of our Souls? Where is the man that is able to conceive after what manner our ſouls are extended through all the members of our bodies? For if it be all in every part of the Body, as is commonly taught, what difference is there between it's manner of being in the whole body and in each of its members? and if it be not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally preſent in each part, why is it not compos'd
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:119039:254"/> of parts, after the manner of bodies, and by conſequence diviſible and corruptible? I am not ignorant that many ſubtle diſtinctions are us'd in this matter, more proper to caſt a miſt before the eyes, then to afford a clear and certain knowledge of it: but I am confident, they are moſt times not underſtood even by thoſe which alledge them. Now let us beſtow our inquiries in ſuch things as yield ſolid ſatisfaction to the mind, and not in ſuch in which thoſe that propoſe them have only deſign'd to ſhew the vivacity of their Underſtandings and their abilities. Otherwiſe, if we betake our ſelves to ſubtleties, forſaking manifeſt deductions, and conclude that for true which we are not able to make out, the Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of our Scholaſticks in this kind will over-cloud our Religion, and ſupply matter enough for contradiction. But there are certain verities reſembling too radiant lights, which dazle if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in themſelves, and in their fountain, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the weakneſs of our eyes, but content and delight if look'd upon in the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they have with others more preceptible by our minds. And this in queſtion is of this Nature.</p>
               <p>Now there are two ways of being aſſured of the verity of this Doctrine. The firſt is that which we have touch'd upon formerly; That every man have ſo high an eſtimation of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, as to believe it abſolutely impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable towards us without a preceeding ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for our offences; and know ſo well to weigh the horror of Sin, that he never dare think of approaching God without confeſſing
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:119039:254"/> ingenuouſly that he ha's deſerv'd both the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral death of the body and the eternal of the Soul, and that it is impoſſible for him ever to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pardon unleſs ſome other ſatisfie for him, and that with a price equivalent to the greatneſs of his crimes and the Dignity of Divine Juſtice. For he that is thus diſpos'd in his ſoul (and we have ſhewn above that the right conſideration of the nature of God requires man to be ſo) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as the means of ſo idoneous a ſatisfaction is propounded to him, he will eagerly embrace it, unleſs he aſcribe too much to Reaſon, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume too much on his own capacity to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend things which are above his reach. But the good opinion we have of our ſelves in being able to dive into abſtruſe matters cauſes us of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to commit moſt pernicious errors. The Second is, for a man to conſider attentively what the Book is, and the Doctrine in general, and in the body of which this makes but a part. For there will appear in the Firſt ſo many evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of its Divinity, and in the Second ſuch an indiſſoluble connection of this point with many other verities of an indubitable certitude and evidence, that it will be impoſſible for the mind of man, if it be not totally obſtinate and hardned, not to acquieſce therein. And in truth, let him begin with the books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Their Antiquity in the firſt place renders them venerable above all other writings of the world. For there are leſt no monuments in all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity that come near them by many Ages: The War of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and the Sacking of <hi>Troy,</hi> to which <hi>Lucretius</hi> limits the knowledge
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:119039:255"/> men have of ancient matters, in theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
<q>
                     <l>Praeterea, ſi nulla fuit genitalis origo</l>
                     <l>Terrai &amp; coeli, ſemperque aeterna fuere,</l>
                     <l>Cur ſupra bellum Thebanum &amp; funera Trojae</l>
                     <l>Non alias alii quoque res cecinere Poetae?</l>
                  </q> And the times of <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> beyond which <hi>Plutarch</hi> is able to diſcover no certainty in Hiſtories, followed a long while after the birth of this great Prophet. The language in which it was written is the mother of all others; of which the ſeveral words which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd from it, and which are as ſlips of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtock, and the names of their very letters bear ſufficient teſtimony. The ſtyle of it is plain indeed, but full of ſuch native decency and graces; its narrations ſo equal, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſo curious a facility, that the truth of what it relates is reſplendent throughout, and ſeems to juſtifie it ſelf with a confidence that none would call it in queſtion; an undubitable evidence of its generoſity. The diſcourſes it aſſigns thoſe it introduces are wonderfully pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical and agreeable to the condition of the perſons. The things which it relates both of the creation of the World and the propagation of Mankinde, upon examination of reaſon alone hold forth a higher evidence then that of veriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude. And it is dubious whether the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the deluge, of the conflagration of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> of the building of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> and the like, more clearly convince the Fables
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:119039:255"/> we meet with in the books of Poets, as a well-proportioned body diſcovers the deformity of the prodigious ſhadows it caſts, or whether thoſe vain worn-out traces of theſe ancient ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities bear a more irrefragable teſtimony to the ſame. The Prophetical eruptions, ſpeak a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit other then humane. The Predictions found therein have been ſo ratifi'd by events, that 'tis too great obſtinacy to diſparage their credit by contradiction. And if ſome things be related to have come to paſs beyond the ordinary ways of nature, as myſterious ſhadows of what was to appear afterwards, and which really appear'd in due time, there reſults a light truely admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from the compariſon of the Verity with the Figure. And the miracles which he performed for confirmation of his doctrine and for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the enterpriſe which himſelf declar'd was committed to him, which might have been refuted by a hundred and a hundred thouſand perſons, if they had been counterfeit, and for defence of which ſo many millions of men would at preſent lay down their lives, clear him from all ſuſpicion of fraud and impoſture. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed then to the books of <hi>Joſuah,</hi> the <hi>Judges, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> and the reſt which writ the hiſtories of the Kings of <hi>Juda,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and there will appear in them ſuch an excellent continuation both of matters and times, ſuch an exact deſcription of Genealogies, a narration of various occurrences arrived both in the Church and State, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Kings and Prophets, great and ſmall, Princes and Vulgar, war and peace, and all ſorts of accidents, which carry with them a thouſand
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:119039:256"/> marks of verity by the correſpondence they have with humane paſſions and affections, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances we obſerve of them in the various adventures of ordinary life, that a man muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bely his own faculties or give belief to ſuch illuſtrious truths. And remarkably here and there occur ſuch excellent inſtances of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence both in juſtice and mercy, ſuch illuſtrious examples of eminent piety and virtue in rare perſonages, ſuch grave admonitions and efficacious exhortations by the mouths of the Prophets, that he muſt exceed rocks in ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that does not reſent ſome lively emotions in his ſoul by reading them. Then go forwards and read the book of the Patience of <hi>Job,</hi> the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon;</hi> Good God, how fraught with wonders! Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you will meet with ſentences ſo full of Wiſdom both in reference to knowledge and moral virtue, that the moſt excellent piece the Philoſophers ever compos'd in that kind is droſs and darkneſs in compariſon; ſometimes with a complaint ſo lamentable that it may melt the moſt rigid hearts with compaſſion; ſometimes with the voice of God ſpeaking and revealing himſelf from Heaven in a moſt auguſt Majeſty ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with lightnings, and with a terrible voice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thunder. In one place an ardent prayer, in another teſtimonies of a fervent piety: here a zeal for the glory of God, and ſo inflam'd a virtue, or elſe ſo violent a hate againſt vice, that when you come to paſs from reading of theſe books to thoſe of the Philoſophers, or of any other whatſoever that ha's aſſai'd to write of
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:119039:256"/> ſuch matters, you will ſeem to be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Veſurius</hi> to <hi>Carcaſus.</hi> In the whole ſeries of them are interſpers'd predictions of future things ſo remote, that no other but the Spirit of God durſt have offered at them; apoſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes to the Nations which were to be converted to the knowledg of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> exultations for the manifeſtation of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſo different from the ordinary thoughts and ſentiments of men, that we muſt forget who we are, if we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the ſame to humane invention. And throughout the whole body compoſed of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſo well adjuſted and diſpoſed in ſo excellent a harmony together, are univerſally diffus'd (like blood replete with ſpirits) vigor, life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation ſo lively, efficacious and ſenſible to the ſoul into what perplexing inquietudes ſoever it falls, that there is none ſo ſweet a refreſhment in any ardor, nor ſoverain balm to whatſoever wound. And laſtly, he that ſhall proceed from thence to the reading of the other Prophets, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he do it with much ſupinity and negligence, will obſerve in each page ſparklings and beams of a light and inſpiration truely Divine. Do they expound what the aim and uſe of the Law is? they do it with moſt profound Wiſdom. Do they reprove and threaten in the name of God? the gravity of their admonitions is inimitable, and the denunciations of his judgements, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; ſo that no humane voice is able to ſtretch to ſo high a ſtrain without breaking, no affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be ſet out in a dreſs ſo ſtately, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and uniform. Do they promiſe? If tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral deliverances, 'tis with demonſtration of
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:119039:257"/> ſo redoubtable a power, that the very name of the Lord of Hoſts, which is ſo often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, ſounds a kinde of grandeur I know not how to expreſs, and which cannot ariſe from humane imagination: If ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> 'tis in termes which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent an inexhauſtible ſea of benedictions and riches. Do they foretell things to come? if it be in obſcure termes, the very obſcurity of the Prophecy is venerable; and there is always ſomething of greatneſs diſcernable croſs the veil, though not very diſtinctly; if it be in plain words, the names of perſons deſigned intire Ages before their birth, times predetermin'd, and circumſtances of matters moſt exactly taken notice of, ſufficiently argue that they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divinations of Daemons, nor humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures; neither nature being capable of ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a foreſight. Then, their tranſports are ſo ſublime and their flights ſo bold, that no man durſt attempt to ſoar ſo high; the doctrine held forth is ſo directly intended to the glory of God and the ſalvation of man, that 'tis not poſſible any evil ſpirit ſhould have been the author of it; and the mixture of the Law with the Goſpel is diſpenſed therein ſo wiſely according to the condition of times, and the oeconomy of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies opening themſelves by degrees main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained after ſuch a rate, that ſhould men and Angels conſpire together, they would fall infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſhort of ſuch an admirable wiſdom. And I entreat ſuch Readers as have any familiarity with the language in which they writ, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame attentively. For I am confident,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:119039:257"/> whatever ſome ſay, there is not to be found in any Author, Greek or Latin, ſo magnificent and pompous an eloquence. And if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them not in their natural language, let them read them conſiderately in ſome verſion performed with care and diligence, eſpecially in thoſe which are commonly call'd Living Tongues. For though the Greek and Latine languages are in their own authors more rich and copious; yet thoſe which live, if well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ag'd, are more plyable to theſe Tranſlations and take off better the impreſſion and graces of the language of the Prophets; and this, becauſe they are capable of new words and phraſes. It will without queſtion appear that all the reproaches profane men caſt upon the Holy Books, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragements of its ſtyle and eloquence, are fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous. If therefore theſe Books teach the doctrine of the Trinity, as we have ſhewn they do, and are delivered to us by divine Inſpiration, as is clearer then the Noon-Sun, what a folly would it be to go about to examine by reaſon the myſteries of the Divine Wiſdom, which it ſelf ha's revealed?</p>
               <p>Now concerning the correſpondence theſe verities have with others unqueſtionable in the Doctrine which holds them forth, it may ſeem ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declar'd in the preceding diſcourſe. Man is fallen into a depth of miſery, and ſo is become an object of pity. Now in whom can he excite it, unleſs in him that is the Father of Mercy? But it was by his ſin, and ſo he is an object of juſtice. And from whom is he to expect puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but from the ſupreme Judge of the World?
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:119039:258"/> Will this Mercy diſplay it ſelf in pardon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out puniſhing? No, that would be to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of juſtice. Will this juſtice be executed upon man himſelf; Nor ſo; this would be to exclude all Mercy, in which the Almighty takes delight. What remains therefore but for God to ſubſtitute a pledge in the room of men? Now it is requiſite that this ſubſtitute ſuffer death, and by conſequence that he be man. And it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that his paſſion be of an infinite value; and for this, he muſt be God; for no other is cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of making ſuch a ſatisfaction. And if he who is God be ſtricken by the hand of God by way of puniſhment, do's it not neceſſarily follow that there are two diſtinct perſons in God? This redemption is unprofitable, if it be not efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly applyed to man. Who ſhall apply it to him? Not himſelf. A blind man might as well open his own eyes, or a Carcaſe raiſe it ſelf out of the grave. And ſince this work of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is common both to the Father and the Son, what is more conſentaneous then for them to conſummate and apply it by a Virtue which is common to them both? Now if it be common to both, it is diſtinct from both. How therefore is there not a Third? This is that which men chiefly ſtumble at in the Chriſtian Religion. In all other things it is ſo conſiſtent with reaſon, that its greateſt enemies dare not gain-ſay it. In this indeed it is in no wiſe incongruous with reaſon, provided it be attended to in a due maner, &amp; we let not looſe the bridle to its preſumptuous curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity. Theſe principles are likewiſe common to both the parties, into which we have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:119039:258"/> all thoſe which profeſs the Chriſtian Name in <hi>Europe</hi> at this day. If there be ſome things embrac'd by either, which ſeem abſurd to reaſon, or contrary to piety, yet it behoveth not forthwith to accuſe Chriſtian Religion for it. It is meet to try the ſame by thoſe Books which both equally own, and explore them by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principles upon which their Religion is built. For if they be conformable thereunto, they will be found in no wiſe repugnant to right reaſon; if not, they muſt be held for humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and Religion diſcharged of the blame.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> That Jeſus is the <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed by the Old Teſtament. Alſo, Of the Divinity of the New.</head>
               <p>WHereas we have evinc'd in the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe that the Chriſtian Religion far ſurpaſſes in excellence of Doctrine that which the Jews of old profeſs'd, how divine ſoever it was; and conſequently that it was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in its place; it is now ſufficiently clear, ſince <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the ſole author of it, and profeſs'd himſelf to be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that he is really the perſon. For how could an Impoſtor have been the interpreter and revealer of ſo celeſtial a Doctrine? And this is chiefly the means by which he verily ought to be judg'd; For 'tis a man's Doctrine which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts what he is. Nevertheleſs, our deſign would not be complete, unleſs we alſo obſerv'd here briefly (becauſe others have moſt diligently and amply acquitted themſelves in this matter) the principal circumſtances of his birth, his Life, and his Death. For there ha's not been the leaſt defect therein, in relation to all that was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore either required or preſignified by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. <hi>Malachi</hi> had writ in theſe expreſs terms (<hi>chap.</hi> 4.) <hi>Behold, I will ſend you Eliah the Prophet, before the comming of the great and dreadful day of the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:119039:259"/> Lord. And he ſhall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> From this place the Jews ſtill expect the comming of <hi>Elias.</hi> But what appearance is there that <hi>Elias</hi> himſelf ſhould be fetcht back from Heaven to converſe again here below on Earth? That after ſo long an enjoyment of the felicities above he ſhould return once more into the miſeries of life? Certainly, as it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for him at his reception into Heaven to be deveſted of the terreſtrial qualities of his body, and clothed with ſutable ones to the place of his new abode; ſo, if he ſhould redeſcende amongſt us, it would be requiſite for him to reſume quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties agreeable with a terrene condition, and to deſpoil himſelf of his celeſtial glories. Now he might well paſs from worſe to better, from an earthly to a heavenly life; but to return from bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to worſe would be a mutation of too much diſadvantage. <hi>Elias</hi> therefore was to come, juſt as <hi>David</hi> was to come: for the Prophets promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him alſo. Not that the Son of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Solomon</hi> ought to ariſe from among the dead, to repoſſeſs the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> of whom <hi>David</hi> was a type, ought to be the conducter and Chieftain of ſpiritual armies, and paſſing through many dangers and fights obtain peace to his people by his glorious victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Thus ought one to be born, who being cloath'd with the ſpirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> and leading the ſame manner of life, might prepare the hearts of men to receive the <hi>Meſſias</hi> by preaching the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of repentance with an extraordinary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority &amp; gravity. And ſuch was <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:119039:260"/> as our Evangeliſts deſcribe him to us. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had ſaid in the ſeventh Chapter of his Prophecies, <hi>Behold, a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his name Immanuel.</hi> And though this might have had its accompliſhment after the time of the Prophets, by the extraordinary birth of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, for a ſign of the deliverance which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd here, yet in the ſecond place it ha's regard to the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> as many things in the Prophets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the type in one reſpect, which are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r'd to the thing ſignified by the type in another. And in truth, beſides that all temporal deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances have, as ſhadows, prefigur'd the great and ſpiritual one, and this being very ſignal ought to prefigure the ſame in a more ſignal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; what kind of ſign was here choſen to aſſure <hi>Achaz</hi> and his people of Deliverance? For if the child of which he ſpoke, was to be born after an ordinary manner, certainly the ſign was not great, nor capable of ſuggeſting much aſſurance. If there ought to be ſomething extraordinary in his birth, the election of this ſign among ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others is ſtrange, if it had no remoter aim. Add hereunto, that were all which the Jews alledge concerning the word <hi>Virgin</hi> true, and that it ſhould ſometimes ſignifie a young woman, becauſe there is but little diſtance of time between theſe two conditions; yet being its proper and moſt common ſignification de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes <hi>a Maid,</hi> 'tis a manner of expreſſion mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly ſtrange, to intimate that a young woman ſhall bear a child, by ſaying, <hi>A Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son.</hi> So that according to this meaning, ſhould the Prophet have ſhewn with
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:119039:260"/> his finger the young woman he ſpoke of, he had left <hi>Achaz</hi> and his people at as great a loſs by this uncouth ſpeech; and the condition of the times was ſutable to ſuch biaſſed Prophecies. Now <hi>Ieſus</hi> was born of a Virgin, in a miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Which the Jews now cannot handſomely deny; whoſe Anceſters that condemn'd him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did him this outrage, though they had rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous laws againſt adulterers, and means enough to prove that he was not born in marriage, to which they might have had the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and his Mother. <hi>Micai</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly deſigned the place of his birth (<hi>chap.</hi> 5.) <hi>But thou Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thouſands of Iudah, yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Iſrael, whoſe goings forth have been from of old from everlaſting.</hi> And all the Prophets promiſed him of the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> in their Revelations, Hiſtories, and Pſalms. As for the place, the Evangeliſts declare it expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and as for his blood, they rehearſe the race of Chriſt from father to ſon and from time to time up to <hi>David, Iudah,</hi> and even <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf. And the Jews never called in queſtion his being of the royal line. <hi>Iacob</hi> prefixed the time of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſubverſion of all government and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical power in <hi>Iudah;</hi> and <hi>Malachi,</hi> before the ruine of the ſecond Temple; <hi>Daniel,</hi> after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty weeks of years, to be reckoned from the time of his Prophecy. And the revelation of it was ſo clear and the tradition founded on it ſo conſtant, that all the Jews waited for this time; and ſeveral impoſtors roſe up about this time to abuſe their expectation. Now Chriſt was born
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:119039:261"/> at the predetermin'd time, when <hi>Herod</hi> poſſeſs'd himſelf of the Kingdom, and extinguiſht all that was left of the race of <hi>David</hi> in any political Power or probability of attempting to gain it; a little before the deſtruction of the Temple, and the total deſolation of the Nation, and the ruine of the Soverainty of <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf, and at the time when the ſeventy weeks of the Prophet were expired. It was foretold that he ſhould be both a contemptible man in his external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and of a Life unblamable in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. For God calls him <hi>his juſt ſervant;</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah, The deſpiſed and rejected of men.</hi> And <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> ſpent the ſpace of about thirty years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known of all, not acknowledg'd even by his kindred, with parents of abject condition, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of royal deſcent: The calamities of the houſe of <hi>David</hi> having reduc'd ſome of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity to theſe termes: and his enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacht to him, as if he had been the Son of a Carpenter, and a Carpenter himſelf. As for the integrity of his Life, his moſt capital Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and calumny it ſelf found nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in it. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> uttered theſe remarkable words in the 35. Chapter of his prophecy; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, your God ſhall come with vengeance, even God with a recompence, he will come and ſave you. Then the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and the ears of the deaf ſhall be unſtopped. Then ſhall the lame man leap us an hart, and the tongue of the dumbe ſhall ſing.</hi> A promiſe too magnificent to receive accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment under any other then the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> both in reference to healing the imperfections of the body, and alſo in relation to the vices of the ſoul
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:119039:261"/> of which thoſe are in a manner reſemblances. As for the firſt, the Miracles which <hi>Jeſus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, were ſo great in themſelves, ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the ſight of his enemies, ſo conſonant to this Prophecy, that none can with any ſhadow of verity queſtion that this Prophecy was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd in him. For he gave ſight to the blind, he healed ſuch as were impotent from the wombe, he raiſed the dead, opened the ears of the deafe, looſned the tongue of the dumbe, commanded the winds and the Sea and they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd him, and ſurpaſſed as well in number as magnificence of his miracles all the Prophets that came before him. 'Tis true, there are ſome Jews who accuſe him of having done the ſame by Magick. But then their Anceſtors who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd him, would have bethought themſelves to make this a part of his Indictment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it into the ſentence of his condemnation. For what law is more ſevere then theirs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting terrible penalties for Sorcerers, and all ſuch as addict themſelves to Magick? And ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he did theſe wonders before their Eyes, under the view and cogniſance of all the world; in the City and the Country, in the houſe and the ſtreet, and for the moſt part in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the greateſt multitudes. Yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accus'd him of Sorcery. Some Phariſees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, whoſe eyes were perſtring'd by the luſtre of his deeds, accus'd him of effecting them by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of Devils. But their own followers did not believe them, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he gave them was perfectly convincing; That his Doctrine wholly tending to the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:119039:262"/> of the Empire of Satan, the Devil would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have confederated with and aſſiſted him that went about thus to undermine the foundations of his Kingdom. And truely what diabolical art or what ſleight of Magick could be imploy'd in reſtoring life to the deceas'd, and ſight to thoſe which never had any, to heal perſons deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately ſick at a great diſtance from him and by his Word alone, and to ſtop a continued flux of blood of twelve years onely by the touching of his garments, to reinfuſe decayed ſtrength in a moment, and rectifie cripled members after long impotence? For what are the works of Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans uſually but illuſions, and feats of jugling, rather then actions ſurpaſſing the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Others of the Jews aſcribe his admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Works to the Cabala, pretending that he ſtole the name of God out of the Temple, and that to that ineffable Name <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was annexed the power of doing miracles. But beſides that this is a ſhameleſs fable, and unworthy to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, what colour is there that four Hebrew Letters ſhould have the power of reſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citating the dead? And if the Name of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabled him to work Wonders, was it with the permiſſion of God himſelf, or againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? If againſt his allowance, ſurely it would be a pitiful caſe ſhould a man by ſubtlety ſteal the name of God and do miracles by it, in ſpight of him to whom it belongs: That God, I ſay, ſhould have deveſted himſelf of his infinite power to transfer it to four ſmall Hebrew Characters by a irrevocable donation. If with his permiſſion and conſent, then hereby he confirm'd the calling
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:119039:262"/> of Jeſus and ratified the open and clear decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he made of being the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Which he would never have done in patronage of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture. God alſo foreſhew'd that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould ſuffer, and <hi>David</hi> apparently ſpecifi'd the manner of his Death: otherwiſe, to what end did he ſay, <hi>They pierced my hands and my Feet?</hi> ſince in thoſe times of his there was not among the Jews, any cuſtome of a puniſhment in which they pierc'd the hands and feet, from whence <hi>David</hi> might borrow this phraſe? For as for what they cavil upon the word, <hi>they pierced me,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as if it ought to be tranſlated, <hi>as a Lion,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ſence of the ſentence, which would by that means become imperfect and in ſuſpence, refutes it. For what can this ſignifie, <hi>As a Lyon my hands and my feet,</hi> there being no connexion to that which precedes? Now our Lord Jeſus hath ſuffer'd death, even the death of the Croſs; by which on the one ſide the words of <hi>David</hi> have been accompliſht, and on the other that ha's been really brought to paſs which was figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively repreſented by the Lifting up of the Serpent: beſides, that the Curſe denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe which hang'd upon the tree, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come expiated thereby. <hi>David</hi> had ſaid in the 16. <hi>Pſalm, Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in Hell, neither wilt thou ſuffer thine Holy One to ſee Corruption.</hi> To what purpoſe ſpoke he thus if he meant it of himſelf, ſeeing he is dead and in his duſt with his fathers? And yet he ſpoke it not extravagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for the Holy Spirit which guided him did not ſuffer theſe words to eſcape him at randome. To whom then ought they rather to be referr'd
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:119039:263"/> then to him, of whom <hi>David</hi> was ſo expreſs a type that he is ſtyled by his Name? Therefore ſince he was to dye, and yet ought not undergo putrefaction in the grave, it follows that he ought to riſe again from the dead; and this our Scriptures teach us of Chriſt, and is of moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident verity, though the Jews pretend diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of it. For why ſhall we not give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to his Diſciples who were eye-witeſſes of it, ſince they gain'd nothing but perſecutions and capital hatreds by maintaining it? Who can imagine that men, who naturally love Life, ſhould ſpontaneouſly abandon themſelves to death, to defend the deluſion of a Death from which they could expect nothing? Moreover, <hi>David</hi> in the 68 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high, thou haſt lead captivity captive, thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived gifts for men.</hi> I beſeech you, who do's he ſpeak of? Is it of God as a perſon diſtinct from the <hi>Meſſias?</hi> It cannot be. Throughout all the whole ſpace of Ages which paſs'd before Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> never any deliverance was wrought for the people of Iſrael, nor extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary favour ſhewn them, whoſe greatneſs or manner may correſpond to this paſſage; and the ſtrain of the whole Hymne teſtifies the contrary. To whom can it ſute but to him in whoſe time was to be ſeen the effect of the words which follow in the ſame place? <hi>Princes ſhall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia ſhall ſoon ſtretch out her hands unto God. By reaſon of which the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the Earth ſhall ſing praiſes unto God, and Pſalms unto the Lord;</hi> that is, to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Now our Lord is aſcended into Heaven after his
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:119039:263"/> glorious reſurrection, whence he hath ſent thoſe admirable gifts of the ſpirit, which have imbued the people of the Earth with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord; whereof there need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofs, then that the Nations, heretofore the moſt ignorant and barbarous, have now ſo much knowledge of the Nature of God, and the truths of Religion, that they exceed the Jews therein as far at leaſt as they were exceeded by the Jews before the preaching of the Goſpel. <hi>Daniel</hi> had foretold that after that Chriſt ſhould be cut off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, after he ſhould have ſuffer'd death, but not for himſelf, <hi>The People of the Prince that ſhall come ſhall deſtroy the City and the Sanctuary:</hi> and Chriſt confirmed this Prophecy by foretelling that of Jeruſalem and the Temple there ſhould not be left one ſtone upon another. Now who can doubt but that the event hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd the Prophecy? Laſtly, it was predicted, that he ſhould deſtroy the Kingdom of Satan and the worſhip of falſe Gods: and ſince his times, they have been no longer in repute, even the moſt famous oracles have loſt their very being. Of which there needs no other teſtimonies then thoſe of Pagan Authors, who inquire after the cauſe of their ceſſation, and of experience after ſo many Ages that their memory is quite abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht.</p>
               <p>Very good (will ſome ſay) but of all this we have no authors beſides the Evangliſts and the Apoſtles, who are therefore juſtly ſuſpected and lyable to exception, as ſpeaking in their own cauſe. And moreover, who will warrant to us (ſay they) that there were Apoſtles hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:119039:264"/> or if there were, that thoſe Writings were of their compoſing? How frequent are cheats committed in ſuch matters.</p>
               <p>Here 'tis difficult to diſpute: for what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and how clear ſoever be brought the thing it ſelf is of greater evidence. And the Jews are very unjuſt and unreaſonable, if having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther warranty to give us of their Religion but the books of their Prophets, whereunto not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they require we ſhould yield an abſolute belief, and plye under thoſe magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent names of <hi>Moſes, David, Jeremy, Iſaiah</hi> and the like; they demand of us other evidence of ours, then the writings of our Apoſtles. For what reaſon is there to aſcribe more to the former then the latter? Yet let us comply in this with the obſtinacy of men. It is demanded whether there were Apoſtles heretofore. But he that ſhould demand whether there was a <hi>Caeſar</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> and an <hi>Alexander</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> might with good reaſon be judg'd troubleſome and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent for indubitating a thing of ſo conſtant cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. And nevertheleſs what remaines of the Empire of <hi>Alexander</hi> that may give us aſſurance of its quondam exiſtence? are there any traces of it either in <hi>Aſia</hi> or <hi>Europe?</hi> Certainly, no ſtatues which were erected to him, no medals, no pillars erected for his monument, no memorial engraven in a rock or mountain, no perſon of his lineage, nor ſhadow of his Empire can give us any certainty of him. There's nothing but the Books of the Ancients for it, of which it may be in like manner demanded whether they be not ſuppoſititious, and whether the Authors
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:119039:264"/> whoſe names they bear, were ever in the world. Onely it ha's continued conſtantly in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of men, that there was ſometimes an <hi>Alexander</hi> ſurnamed the Great by reaſon of his virtues and grandeur. And what have we of <hi>Caeſar?</hi> His Commentaries; which may with as much reaſon be call'd in doubt as the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul?</hi> For what more lively character do thoſe bear of that great Emperor then theſe do of this great Apoſtle? More then this, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence can be produc'd but I know not what vain pretended inſcriptions, ſome mutilous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents and the foundation of ſome old caſtle, without any other title of its author then the ancient tradition that the <hi>Romanes</hi> waged great wars with our <hi>Gaules</hi> under his conduct? The moſt eminent token remaining of him is a vain ſhadow of his Empire transfer'd from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Germany,</hi> and his name which is perpetuated from one to another by thoſe Princes. Now is there any thing in all this to be compar'd with the immarceſſible evidences which the Apoſtles have left of themſelves in the whole earth? And if the name of <hi>Caeſar</hi> retain'd by the <hi>German</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and that carkaſs of his Empire are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof that there was a great Prince of that name, is not the name of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> preſerved by the Biſhops of that place, and their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to which thoſe <hi>Caeſars</hi> have ſubjected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, an authentick teſtimony that there was a Saint <hi>Peter?</hi> The <hi>Romane</hi> Name is indeed periſht and the Nations have ſhook off the yoak of its obedience, and out of the ſhivers of that great body are riſen up divers Kingdoms, who own
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:119039:265"/> it no longer, how ever renown'd Emperors and formidable armies it had heretofore. But the Chriſtian Name is Living, and the memory of thoſe who founded it, though we be now far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from their Generation, ſo freſh and deep in the minds of men, that a ſelf-oblivion will ſooner arrive to all mankind then they will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them. They are continually ſpoken of in life, they are ſought to for conſolation in death; the knowledge of them is inſtil'd into the ſouls of little children with their milk, who do not ſo ſoon underſtand that they are men, as they do that they are Chriſtians and diſciples of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. If therefore a much leſs certain tradition be not queſtion'd, why ſhall that which is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant be call'd into doubt? If belief is given to ſome fragments of ſtatues, and ſome old trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant arches defac'd by time, ſhall we not give credit to ſo many Temples and infinite other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick monuments? Wherefore it remains that there are certain things which though no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe known then by tradition and common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, nevertheleſs cannot be contradicted but by contentious ſpirits and ſuch as are inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in their impudence. For when a thing containes nothing incredible in it ſelf, and is moreover univerſally receiv'd; when all memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials that can be requir'd of it are found both in books &amp; monuments; when the multitude of thoſe which affirm it is innumerable in compariſon of thoſe which deny it; when it is embraced by all ſorts of ſpirits and of all conditions, high and low, learned and ignorant, rich and poor; when it ha's got footing in ſeveral Nations, paſs'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:119039:265"/> ſeas and mountains, and penetrated into the moſt remote regions; when it ha's taken ſuch root in the minds of men that millions might be found all abſolutely diſpos'd to ſuffer death in defence of it; it behoveth to have loſt common ſenſe, or to be immenſely brainſick, to be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtill to diſtruſt it. The Queſtion, whether the Books attributed to them be theirs or not, perhaps may ſeem of ſomewhat more difficulty to be reſolv'd. And yet, if we be minded to uſe the ſame argument, the Chriſtians have had ſo conſtant an opinion from all time that they are ſo, and all Nations and Languages ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly acknowledg'd it, and render'd them ſo uniform a teſtimony, that if we doubt not but the Books bearing the names of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> are truely theirs, much more ought we to be aſſured of theſe, to which ſuch a cloud of witneſſes of all qualities and in all times have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven moſt peremptory and convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. But let us cloſe with them a little nearer.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing which ought to be conſider'd in a writing is the matter, whether it be both excellent of it ſelf, and conſentaneous to the condition of the perſon who propounds it. For I am perſwaded the Marſhal <hi>de Stroſſy</hi> who was an aſſiduous reader of <hi>Caeſar's</hi> Commentaries, was not ſo much aſſured by the title of the Book that they had that incomparable Captain for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as by the traces of an extraordinary mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſufficiency he diſcern'd in them, which could not have been made or written but onely by a man that was a perfect maſter in the art of
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:119039:266"/> war. Now who did the Apoſtles pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be? Miniſters ſent to proclaim the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and diſpenſers of his heavenly my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. Let it examin'd what conſonance there is between their writings and this profeſſion, and a moſt perfect correſpondence will be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. For in that which they have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of his hiſtory, they paint him out to us ſo much to the life, and with ſo natural a pencil, that he that reads them attentively cannot but ſeem to himſelf, to ſee, underſtand and converſe with him amongſt his diſciples in <hi>Judea.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over all their doctrines and narrations have that aim, without ever intermixing any thing of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſciences or affairs, and extraneous matters little conducing to their purpoſe; and yet even in that which they teach they diſcover ſuch a profound wiſdom, ſo unknown to all thoſe that ever profeſs'd learning, and nevertheleſs ſo conformable to the humane Underſtanding when once it ha's comprehended the ſame, that it is abundantly manifeſt, that they in truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the fountain of thoſe myſteries what they diſpenc'd to us, and that they pourtray'd <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſo lively by having a perfect Idea of him deeply imprinted in their ſouls. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the matter of thoſe writings is ſuch that they could not have been made but by thoſe who were either Apoſtles or alike qualifi'd, what is more rational then to attribute the ſame to them, ſeeing they bear their names inſcrib'd in the front, and the aire (as I may ſo ſpeak) and genius of them in their aſpect?</p>
               <pb n="507" facs="tcp:119039:266"/>
               <p>In the next place the ſtyle is to be conſider'd; which ought to be agreeable both to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Writer, and the capacity of thoſe for whoſe uſe the writing is intended. Now the Apoſtles were indeed exalted to a moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dignity, but withall teachers of humility, and writ not to refined wits accompliſht by the acquiſt of Sciences, but to the moſt ſimple vulgar. What then behoved them to do but chooſe a plain manner of writing and phraſes to which their Diſciples were accuſtomed, to the end not to obſcure myſteries of themſelves above the ordinary reach of men by an elaborate and ſublime ſtyle? And this they have done by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in <hi>Greek</hi> indeed, becauſe that language was moſt generally in uſe among all ſorts of Nations which were to be brought to the knowledge of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but they have ſo accommodated it to the mode of the Hebrew Tongue, that rendring themſelves underſtood by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they have not relinquiſht the idiomes to which thoſe were accuſtomed who by reading the books of the Prophets were already ſomewhat lightly imbu'd &amp; prepoſſeſs'd with thoſe myſteries. As likewiſe it would have been inconvenient for that Divine Wiſdom, unknown to all the Nations and which had convers'd with the Jewiſh alone, though veil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſort with ceremonies and legal doctrines, to have all at once quitted its ſimple and modeſt attire, to put on the pompe of the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> eloquence. For beſides that it would have been diſguis'd thereby as in a ſtrange garbe, the love it had excited in our minds might have been attributed to that quaint attire, whereas we
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:119039:267"/> ought to be invited to it onely by the attractive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its ſimple and natural beauty. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs there ſhine ſo many beams of celeſtiall light, and ſuch a venerable Majeſty through this humility and modeſt outſide, I mean the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its language, that whoſo obſerves it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively will judge it never to have been of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane extraction. But in this it is in ſome meaſure different from the manner in which it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the Prophets, becauſe it was then ſomething terrible, for that deſigning to awe the minds of men rather by the reſpect of its Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty then by very much knowledge, and unveil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf but ſeldom, it was requiſite it ſhould uſe a high tone and full of authority. And thus we ſee why the Prophets ſeem to uſe more lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtrains and a more magnificent procedure. But now that it offers it ſelf to perfect knowledge, taking away the band from before the eyes of men and the veil from its own face, it ſhews it ſelf more obliging and gracious. Hence it is that the Apoſtles do not thunder and lighten, but diſcourſe and reaſon, and perſwade the humane mind by the conſequence of their arguments; whereas the former amaz'd it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, becauſe 'tis proper to God to be conſtant, and on the contrary to man to be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; ſo that the Works of God, as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from an infallible wiſdom, are correſpondent to themſelves in all their parts; whereas thoſe of man, both through his ignorance which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid, and his natural inconſtancy, uſually vary and interfere; ſince the Apoſtles being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for Teachers to the whole world, ought
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:119039:267"/> to have been taught by God, it behoveth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily that every one be both conſiſtent with himſelf and concordant with the reſt. Let the New Teſtament therefore, the writings of which bear the names of eight or ten authors, be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſider'd, for diſcovering what harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they make together: certainly the hiſtories will be ſound ſo conſonant, the opinions ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform, the ſtyle ſo like, and the ratiocinations proſecuted ſo equally, that though according to the diverſity of each mans genius there be ſome kind of air which diſtinguiſhes them, ſo that it may be well obſerv'd that they are not the work of one alone, yet in this conſort of ſeveral voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of which each bears its meaſure and part, there cannot be found any real diſcord or diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the Chriſtian Religion ought to be built upon the foundations of the Jewiſh, ſo that what was begun by the Prophets, ought like an edifice to be continued by the Apoſtles, and finiſh'd according to the ſame deſign; let the Old Teſtament be compared with the New, that it may be ſeen whether there be any part of the ſtructure not correſpondent to the foundation, vitiating the proportion, diſordering the work, or making a breach. On the contrary it will be found that there is no other difference between the Old Teſtament and the New in reference to the doctrine of ſalvation propounded by both, but that it was in the former as it were in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and in the latter as in its perfect age; there the foundations were laid of it, which ſcarce aſcend above the ground, here 'tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:119039:268"/> into a complete ſtructure as high as the clouds. 'Tis there like ſeed ſhouting out its verdure amidſt the ceremonies of the Law, as amongſt ſtrange plants; here it is like a floriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and plentiful crop which ha's overtop'd them all. And laſtly God ſpeaks there indeed to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> as a Saviour and Redeemer, but 'tis from the middle of acloud, whence ſometimes iſſue forth lightnings and the noiſe of thunder; here he diſpells all obſcurity and ſhews a calme and ſerene aſpect with a mild and charming ſtrain.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:119039:268"/>
               <p>[Hence alſo it comes to paſs that they who betake themſelves ſeriouſly to the reading of theſe books, being enamor'd on the excellency of the things they teach, perſwaded by the evidence of truth, deeply affected with the knowledge of the nature of Sin which they hold forth, comforted effectually with the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which they exhibite againſt the ſame, and raiſed by the gracious promiſes they meet with therein, to a lively hope of a glorious immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, are tranſported with ſuch ardor to embrace them, that all other things afterwards, how commendable ſoever, ſeem to them in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, jejune, languide and diſguſtful, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the right end of humane life, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable towards what is alone of importance and neceſſity in it, to wit, The knowledge of God, for whoſe glory we were created; and The knowledge of the Chief good, whereunto we have a natural tendency; and the means to obtain the ſame, without which we are deſtitute of all hope. For admit you were imbued with all the Philoſophy of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> underſtood all the excellent Learning of the <hi>Romane</hi> Civil Laws, poſſeſs'd all the ſkill in Phyſick which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> have left the world; had turned over all the writings of the ancients, and treaſur'd up a magazine of all hiſtories, obſerv'd all the motions of the Heavens, acquir'd the knowledge of all Arts and perfection in all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and diſcover'd the moſt abſtruſe ſecrets in the Mathematicks or in Nature, indeed ye might find ſomething of contentment to your mind by noble ſpeculations, and avoid many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances
<pb facs="tcp:119039:269"/> of life, and be ennabled to provide for your ſecurity and the recovery of your health for a while, and perhaps gain a high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute amongſt men: But when a man is at the point of death, and conſcience ſummons him before the Tribunal of God, and he reflects ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly on the immortal ſtate of his ſoul, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of all this vaniſhes, and ther's nothing to animate and comfort us but only the knowledge of the things which are reveal'd to us in theſe divine writings; which moreover, both the multitude and the conſtancy of ſuch as have maintained with their blood to be of Divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, do juſtly challenge admiration. For ſince it ha's not been through ferocity of courage that they underwent death with ſuch alacrity, being ſimple men for the moſt part and humble and quiet-minded in their whole lives; nor through ambition of vain glory, from affecting which they were very remote in all their converſation; nor through a blind and obſtinate headineſs and opiniaſtry, having always ſhewn themſelves ſubmiſſive to all good reaſons, and reſpectful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all perſons and eſpecially towards ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Powers; nor through brutiſh ſtupidity, ſince in all other matters they appear'd men of ſober judgements, capable of reaſon and prudence; nor through ignorance of the nature of Death, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they preach't to others that 'tis an effect of the vengeance of God upon the Sin of men, and were fully perſwaded of the immortality of their ſouls; but the onely hope of glory promiſed in thoſe books raiſed them beyond all fear; &amp; they muſt needs have had a high perſwaſion of their
<pb facs="tcp:119039:269"/> verity, ſince it was capable to ingenerate ſo powerful and impregnable a confidence in their minds.</p>
               <p>And whereas there were many things which might have reclaim'd and deterr'd them from embracing theſe Books; as the continual afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they promiſe in this life (for ſuch is the gratification they hold forth here to thoſe which receive them) the love of their eſtates, honors, and children, which naturally poſſeſſes the mindes of men; the reproach of an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous death, which is ſo intolerable to minds that own any thing of generoſity; the ſeverity and reiteration of torments, ſufficient to ſhake the moſt firm reſolution; it follows that there muſt have been ſome more then humane inducements which fix'd their minds ſo unmoveably on an object expos'd to ſo numerous incomfortable perplexities and violences. Then, conſider eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the almoſt infinite multitude of Martyrs, and their long perſeverance through ſo many Ages. For had there been but two or three, it might have been deem'd Nature had intended ſome extraordinary exploit in them, or that they were tranſported by ſome fooliſh fancy; and every Religion might produce ſome like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. But what charm could have been po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent enough to induce ſo many millions of men, women and children, of all ages, conditions, ſexes, and in ſo many moſt bloody perſecutions renewed from time to time and age to age, to deſpiſe death ſo magnanimouſly, in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a doctrine, which had no other trouble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, may ſeem ought to have been diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:119039:270"/> to them both becauſe it oppos'd their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which we follow ſo willingly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd them of all the ſweetneſſes and delights of life? Nevertheleſs thoſe Violences have been the means to propagate it throughout the whole Earth; and reſolution and patience, the arms wherwith it ha's deſtroy'd the empire of the falſe Gods, and expelled the Demons from govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World: Other kind of Armies it never depended on to extend its conqueſts even to the ends of the World and ſubdue the greateſt and moſt flouriſhing Empires. All other Religions are confounded; or if any are ſtill upheld, 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the favor of Princes &amp; force of arms. This, though all the powers of the world were enemys to it at it's birth, though it never attempted any thing but by the Voice onely, never us'd other rampart for defence but an invincible patience, ha's born up through 1600 years, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the hearts of Princes themſelves. But of this ſubject there are expreſs Treatiſes, to which we refer the Reader, and proceed to examine in the next Chapter a certain Opinion excogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated of old by ſome giddy ſpirits, and reviv'd in our dayes, againſt the Divinity of Chriſt; which though deſtitute of all apparence of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, do's not ceaſe to take root and grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many perſons, and therefore requires our conſideration.]</p>

               <p>THere are ſome people in theſe dayes who conceive they render the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion very acceptable, when they give this account of matters pertaining to it; That true Religion conſiſts in the internal piety of the ſoul towards God and in the ſincere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant exerciſe of true virtue towards men; That of all Religions, the Chriſtian is that which holds forth moſt knowledge of the nature of God and true virtue, reducing the humane mind to the principles of nature it ſelf and rectifying it from all the perverſe opinions which the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of depraved Ages had induc'd into it: But becauſe the naked and plain propoſing of theſe matters would have been very little ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual with men, their own affections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining them more powerfully to vice then vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and for that the exhortations of a man merely man would not have been very preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; Chriſt, who was the chief and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent promoter of it, that he might render his
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:119039:271"/> preaching more authentick, aſſum'd the glorious appellation of the Son of God and pretended to be God too; to the end that, it being natural to us to receive with reverence what proceeds from the Deity, his Doctrine might be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and firmely embrac'd, his pretended di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine dignity and the danger of rejecting what God is author of, conciliating a ſacred and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable authority unto him. Whence it was, that like as when ſome great ſtructure is to be built, ſcaffolds are erected round about it, which of themſelves make no part of the Work, but are ſerviceable for conveying materials upwards and for the ſtanding of workmen; ſo in the ſtructure of Chriſtian Religion ſome poſitions were employ'd, which of themſelves are but mere fictions, but yet conduce to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of profitable and excellent truths: Such are the doctrine of the Trinity, that of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Eternal Word, of Juſtification by means of Chriſt's death, and others which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on theſe; which are in their judgement Pious Frauds (as they ſpeak) uſeful to very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous effects, and might be imploy'd with a ſafe conſcience, becauſe 'tis a good thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive when the deluſion renders men better, more happy and more wiſe.</p>
               <p>Now this Opinion is ſo ſtrange and ſwarmes with ſo many abſurd impieties, that not the ſcarcity but the abundance of Arguments which ariſe all at once in the mind of whoſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders it, renders me anxious where I ſhould begin. For in the firſt place, it is requiſite that they take away all correſpondence between the
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:119039:271"/> Old Teſtament and the New, and deny that our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Becauſe the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt was grounded on this point, That God had heretofore by his Prophets promis'd a <hi>Meſſias</hi> to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ſhould be the Redeemer of the Nation; and he was ſent accordingly by God for that end in the fullneſs of time t in which regard he invited all the world to receive him as the Supreme Prophet. Let them ſpeak it out therefore confidently whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed by the Old Teſtament, or not. For if he be not, it behov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to become Jews, and to account him as they do for the greateſt Deceiver that ever was upon the earth, and hence forward turn our Churches into Synagogues, reducing all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian order to the ancient manner of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. If he be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed by the Old Teſtament, he is God; for that deſcribes him to be ſuch, as we have ſhewn by irrefrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proofs. And that thoſe Books of <hi>Moſes, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and the Prophets, are divine, what we have ſpoken above in the matter leaves it no longer doubtful. Nevertheleſs, admit (for the preſent) they be writings purely humane; ſurely theſe excellent Theologers will not deny (leaſt the reading ſhame them) but that they agree all in this particular, That from the Nation of the Jews ought one day to ariſe a great and rare perſonage who ſhould be King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſhould be called the Son and the Branch of the Lord himſelf. And this hath been the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that people in all times, with which they comfort themſelves ſtill in their deplorable
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:119039:272"/> deſolation. But what moved them to ſpeak in this manner, if they had no other inſtinct but from their own mind? Who incited <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſet this fraud firſt on foot? Why did the others many Ages after ſo carefully cheriſh, ratifie and augment it in ſeveral circumſtances with other falſe prophecies? What profit did they reap by deluding the world with ſuch a hope? They muſt have had intelligence ſo many ages before with a man who was not yet in being, to foretell that he ſhould exiſt; and this man born by chance at the juſt time which they preſum'd to determine, muſt have taken occaſion from theſe fortuitous predictions and the expectation rais'd by them in the minds of men, to declare himſelf the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom ſo many prophets in ſo many different times had unanimouſly preſag'd was to exiſt. Now it would be a ſtrange caſe, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould firſt of all, without any neceſſity of ſo doing or advantage by it in reference to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of governing the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the eſtabliſhment of his power, take up a fancy of the future ariſing of ſome great Prophet; and then another ſhould come two or three hundred years after, and revive this prediction made at randome and enlarge and clear it up with other new (for this opinion was ſucceſſively more and more confirm'd and rooted in the minds of men) and that at length, at the time prefixt and the ſet period, there ſhould be found one both confident enough to draw all thoſe preſages to his advantage, and ſo favor'd by fortune that all the circumſtances of his birth, his life, and his death ſhould meet together in his perſon. Surely
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:119039:272"/> ther's as much likelihood in this as in the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Epicurus</hi> concerning the framing of the world by the caſual lighting together of Atomes. But there's ſomething yet more ſtrange. If they were predictions purely humane and alſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous, like the Ephemerides of <hi>Noſtradamus;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were cloath'd in magnificent terms, and there was nothing promis'd leſs then a King ſitting upon the throne of <hi>David,</hi> who was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> faln into ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable an eſtate under the power of the <hi>Romans;</hi> If Jeſus were merely man and intended to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage himſelf by the fooliſh hopes of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what a prepoſterous madneſs was it to take the courſe he did? In ſtead of exciting the people to ſedition againſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> he commands to pay tribute, and pays it himſelf to give example: In ſtead of inſinuating into the affections of daring adventurous men and ſuch as he might uſe for Captains, he makes choiſe of a dozen poor Fiſhermen, and people of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to have them continually in his train: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of erecting his Nation to magnanimity, he betakes himſelf to preach humility and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: In ſtead of imploying the virtue of doing miracles he was ſo mighty in, to aſtoniſh <hi>Herod</hi> or <hi>Pilate</hi> in ſome ſurpriſe or battail, he heals the lame and the blind and the dumb and the paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick: And that which is, if theſe Opinioniſts be credited, the height of folly, inſtead of raiſing men into hope of his victories, he foretells to them which followed him that he was to dy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, and ſharpely reproves one of them who went about to diſſwade him from that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:119039:273"/> of his. Was this the way, if it was a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Deſign, to be get in the world already poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes'd with hope of a <hi>Meſſias</hi> for a great Earthly King, a belief that he was the perſon which was promiſed by their Prophets? Surely <hi>Mahomet</hi> us'd not this courſe, who takes arms in hand, gives freedom to ſlaves, and becauſe he knew his doctrine could not ſupport it ſelf by the prop of truth, plants it in all places, where he can by wars and battles. Wherfore to conceive a perſon ſhould endevor to ſerve himſelf, after this manner, of the preſumptions and expectations of men, is not to fancy a man but a lunatick. In the next place, I aſk, whether Jeſus Chriſt, when he called ſome perſons with him to ſerve him in the work he undertook (as nothing is more apparent then that he had twelve peculiar Apoſtles) he diſcover'd this ſecret of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Divinity to them, or whether he abus'd them aſwell as other men? For if he diſcover'd the ſame to them, 'twas a wonderful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot, that he ſhould ſtyle himſelf the Son of God, deport himſelf for very God, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves his meſſengers, ſent immediately from him to promulgate his doctrine, and at laſt for their reward, he ſhould be ignominiouſly crucifi'd, and each of them reſpectively after divers dangers both by Sea and Land, after im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments, ſtonings, tortures and racks, ſhould conclude their miſerable and painful lives by cruel and ſhameful deaths. Truely, though he choſe Fiſhers and men of low condition, yet I believe there was none among them ſo ſtupid as to be capable of being perſwaded to partake in
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:119039:273"/> this enterpriſe upon theſe conditions. For as for his having induc'd them to it by this onely conſideration, that great good ſhould come thereby to the World, and that the Nations ſhould be converted by their word from Idols to the true God, there was ſo little colour in the thing, that he would never have been believ'd; ſo little of that generoſity in them which leads men to promote the univerſal good of the world without appearance of other recompenſe then miſery and death, that none of them would have forſook his boat or his cottage. If he abus'd them alſo and impos'd upon them by his fair lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, 'tis yet a thing ſurpaſſing all admiration, that this deceit ſhould have rendred them of idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots and ruſticks, the moſt excellent perſons of the world, and incited them (who knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond mending nets) to undertake the reformation of Religion and manners of all the people of the habitable world. For even a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecter of the Goſpel cannot but judge it requiſite for them to have been endow'd with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary graces, not adequate to Fiſhers and toll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherers, that they might perſwade men to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace things of ſuch a ſurpriſing nature, and bring it ſo to paſs, that whereas <hi>Mahomet</hi> with all his Armies, and they which have ſucceeded him, have not been able to eſtabliſh a firm Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but in the ſpace of ſome hundreds of years, twelve mean and deſpicable men, in half an Age drew the greateſt part of the World to them, and eſtabliſht an Empire over the conſciences of men which continues unſhaken after ſo many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; and furthermore, which is obſervable
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:119039:274"/> above the reſt, they effected this by teaching men things repugnant to their natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and exhorting them to dye courageouſly for one that was crucifi'd; whereas <hi>Mahomet</hi> publiſh'd a Law which flatters the body with carnal pleaſures and likewiſe the mind by indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it in its moſt violent paſſions? But will they venture to give credit to what the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writes concerning himſelf? We have ſhewn above that it would be too great impudence to deny the Epiſtles which bear his name to be his, too great perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity not to believe it. I demand therefore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he relates the means by which he was converted to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he do's it according to truth, or to promote the Illuſion? For if it were onely to play his part in the Comedy, what advantage was it to him to abandon the honors and priviledges he enjoy'd in his own Nation, and expoſe himſelf to hunger and thirſt, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of his Countrymen and the ſury of cruel beaſts, onely to deceive the world in favor of another Deceiver, and he one that was crucifi'd, for which he had no other reward to hope, but at length to periſh by the ſame ſort of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If it was according to truth, what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had a dead man to cauſe him to ſee ſuch viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſpeak to him from heaven and captivate all his thoughts (as he ſpeaks) to his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
               <p>Yet perhaps both the one and the others, Chriſt and his Embaſſadors, intended the glory of God, and did all this in favour of true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, by an honeſt zeal which clos'd their eyes
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:119039:274"/> againſt all dangers, and was alſo ſeconded with ſome eſpecial ſtrength from God ennabling them to contemn all things in compariſon of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of their enterpriſe. Let us therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what their piety and virtue may have been if the opinion of theſe people be admitted. And firſt, did they uſe this proceeding by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God? No, ſurely; For God, who is the God of truth, would not have commanded them to teach a Lye, or to make uſe of one to perſwade ſome other thing that were true. He is powerful to cauſe the truth to be embrac'd by other means; and a greater injury cannot be done to him then to go about to gratifie him with what he hates. Much leſs would God have commanded a mere man to call himſelf his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son and God equal to him, ſo to add blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy and ſacriledge to a lye. Indeed what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is there, that whereas men ought to honor and venerate him as God alone, he ſhould not onely have favour'd by his connivance but enjoynd by his expres commandment that a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man ſhould take upon him to be eternal God, and draw the hearts and veneration of men to himſelf? But if they had no ſuch command, what prodigious boldneſs would it have been for a man, whoſe conſcience was convinc'd he was no more, to dare to call himſelf God? And what a hideous impiety in thoſe who ſeconded him in this deſign to preach him for ſuch through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world? Theſe people make ſhew of commending Chriſt becauſe he brought the minds of men to the knowledge of the purity of virtue, and taught a more refin'd and exquiſite
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:119039:275"/> holineſs then any that ever was beſides; and yet they repreſent him to us the moſt notorious lyar and moſt impious blaſphemer of men. The wiſe men of old exclaimed againſt the folie of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who ſuffer'd himſelf to be almoſt flatter'd into a belief that he was the Son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> though he liv'd in a dark Age and Country, in which the ſtories of the lewdneſs of the Gods made it no incredible thing; <hi>Bacchus</hi> and ſome others worſe being in the number, whoſe atchievements were ſhort of his. But theſe ſubtle people we deal with, repreſent him to us for a modeſt perſon and worthy of imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his virtue, whom they judge to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed the world by ſo notorious an impoſture. Moreover, what piety could Chriſt have had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God? For what an inſolence was this to believe himſelf God if he was not ſo? And if he did not believe it, why did he not, having no command to profeſs himſelf ſuch, tremble with horror as oft as he reflected on God and his own blaſphemy? Certainly, if he had been ſuch as theſe people deſcribe him, he had deſerved far worſe then the croſs which he ſuffer'd. But behold ſomething yet more ſtrange. They ſay that among the great and glorious things which Chriſt did, this excels the reſt, That he aboliſht Idolatry and the rable of Gods which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd by the Pagans, and reſtor'd the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and true worſhip of the Deity: And yet, if what they ſay be true, he ha's eſtabliſh'd the higheſt and moſt univerſal Idolatry that ever was ſeen in the world. For almoſt all Nations have embrac'd the doctrine of Chriſt: And
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:119039:275"/> amongſt thoſe Nations very few perſons can be found but acknowledge him for <hi>God bleſſed for ever.</hi> Nor is it material here to alledge that his intention was not to be acknowledg'd for ſuch. For why did he call himſelf God, unleſs that men might believe it? Wherefore does he complain of the incredulity of the Jews when they will not acknowledge him for ſuch, but accuſe him of blaſphemy? And how would he have men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him God without adoring him, ſince it is as much ſin not to adore him whom we believe to be God, as to adore him whom we eſteem not to be ſo? Beſides, he never repell'd any that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd to him under that notion, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles univerſally own it. Was it not therefore by his commandment? Or, if it were not by his expreſs commandment, ought not he to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd ſo dangerous a miſtake?</p>
               <p>One thing there is which I would underſtand certainly, whether they againſt whom I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, give any credit to the Books which we call the Goſpel. For what ever good outſide they wear, I doubt they believe them not at all, and withall think no <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was ever in the world; and conſequently all this Diſcourſe is abſolutely unprofitable: they muſt be referr'd to the preceeding diſpute, in which I prov'd their Divinity againſt the Jews and others like them. If they afford any belief to thoſe Books, certainly they will never accuſe them of having forg'd the teſtimonies render'd of Chriſt from heaven, the authors of which might not only have contradicted one another, but might have been convinc'd of fal ſhood by fifty thouſand perſons.
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:119039:276"/> What then was the meaning of God in theſe words, <hi>This is my Son in whom I am well pleaſed?</hi> As for the miracles which he wrought, as raiſing the dead, giving ſight to ſuch as were born blind, healing inveterate lameneſſes of many years, and the like, they could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any but a ſpecial aſſiſtance of a power truely divine. And what appearance is there that God ſhould have afforded his infinite power to ſuch an impoſtor to cauſe men to believe in him, and conſequently to found ſuch a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and univerſal Idolatry? We know, ſaid one, God hears not the wicked. But who ever was more wicked then Chriſt if he was ſo impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſuch a blaſphemer as this Opinion repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him. Then, in reference to the certain predictions which Chriſt made of things to come into which no humane conjecture could dive, there needs no other proofs of them then by comparing the correſpondence which the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts obſerve of them with the events them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. He foretold that he ſhould dy, and it came to paſs accordingly. But which is more, he foretold that he ſhould riſe again, and he was not deceived in his aſſurance. He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the ruine of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and the <hi>Romanes,</hi> as if they had been hired by him for that purpoſe, fullfill'd his Prophecy. He declar'd that when he was once lifted up on high, he would draw all men to him; and experience atteſts the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this oracle. For his Croſs is like a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard lifted up before the Eyes of all Nations to ſummon and invite them to his knowledge. Now many others indeed have foretold things to
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:119039:276"/> come; but I judge it impoſſible for ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as Chriſt would have been had he been ſuch as theſe people deſcribe him, to have obtain'd the ſpirit of Prophecy from God. <hi>Balaam</hi> ſometimes propheſied of things to come; but it was for the good of the people. But this of Chriſts would have been to gain credit to the word of an impoſtor, to lead men into many ſnares, and eſpecially, as was ſaid, for God to lend his hand to the ſeting up of Idolatry. As for what theſe good the people ſay, that it was lawful to abuſe men in ſome points in order to leading them to embrace certain excellent virtues; although it be a ſtrange and abſurd method of teaching truth by the favor of prodigious falſities, and a wilineſs uncommendable by prudent judgements, yet ſhould it be admitted, it ought not to be practis'd unleſs in matters which draw no pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences after them; as when the ſimplicity of childhood is beguil'd by ſmearing honey or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar on the brim of the cup which contains a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal potion,
<q>
                     <l>—Deceptaque non capiatur,</l>
                     <l>Sed potius tali facto recreata valeſcat.</l>
                  </q> But the uſing impious and blaſphemous falſities, and which are infallibly effective of ſuch idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, had Chriſt and his Apoſtles practis'd it, they had not followed that incomparable precept which they give us for a rule of our actions, <hi>Not to do evil, that good may come of it.</hi> As for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinions, being they are conſequent of this, and by reaſon of their dependency impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:119039:277"/> prov'd in the proof of their primitive prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, I ſhall not inſiſt upon demonſtrating the truth of them. Only I ſhall intimate, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had been a perſon of a ſtranglye diſtemper'd mind, to labor ſo much in diſputing againſt the Gentiles from the maximes of Nature, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Jews from the conſtitutions of the Law, to draw arguments from the books of the Old Teſtament, to expound allegories, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, raiſe and reſolve objections, in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrine of juſtification by faith, and of predeſtination or eternal election, and other like doctrines, if they were nothing but ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. His writings diſcover a wiſdom too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found to leave place for an accuſation of ſo inept and ridiculous deceit. But the cauſe theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpeak after this rate, is, that they never read or never underſtood the Holy Scriptures and the oeconomy of Chriſtian Religion. For did they attentively conſider them, they would eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the point of Chriſts incarnation in this doctrine, is like the image of <hi>Phidias</hi> in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Minerva;</hi> which if taken away, the whole work is diſſolv'd; if let alone, all the parts of the ſtatue are terminated in the ſame with ſuch art and wiſdom, that an obſerving mind is raviſh'd with admiration at the whole contrivance. But let us now return to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and bring it to concluſion.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> That Indifference in the profeſſing all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions is not juſtifiable according to the Chriſtian Religion, which Party ſoever be embraced. And for Concluſion, The Refutation of the Pretext propounded in the Preface.</head>
               <p>WE have by the Divine aſſiſtance ſhewn by reaſons in which all endu'd with any ſenſe of piety, and even in whom nature and reaſon are not abſolutely perverted, ought to acquieſce, That the Jewiſh Religion having been heretofore alone of divine inſtitution, the Chriſtian hath by the authority of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſo ſucceded it, as that it hath wholly abrogated its uſe; and That this latter bears infinite evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of its heavenly original, both in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of its doctrine, and the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it with the ancient Prophecies. We alſo intimated at the beginning, that there are two principal Parties of Chriſtians, under which all are ranked that wear this name, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in two principal Points, on which all their other controverſies depend. One of theſe Parties holds that that particular Revelation by which God hath ordain'd Religion and matters pertaining to his ſervice, ha's been left to men
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:119039:278"/> by two ways; namely by the Scripture, and by verbal Tradition; the Scripture to ſerve for a foundation to Tradition, and Tradition to be a ſupplement in the deficiency of the Scripture, for that it contains not all things neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and even in what it do's contain, is of dubious underſtanding, and hath need of the interpretation of Tradition. Moreover, that the diſpenſing of Tradition ha's been committed to the hands of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to uſe it with a Soverain and Apoſtolical authority, and a promiſe from God to be abſolutely infallible in it. The other Party acknowledge no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Divine Wiſdom, then that which is contained in the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, rejecting all verbal Tradition in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to things neceſſary to ſalvation. And as for the authority of the <hi>Pope</hi> concerning the infallible interpretation of the Word of God, they not onely do not acknowledge it, but dare to condemne it as tyrannical and Antichriſtian. It remains therefore to inquire briefly, whether this flexible and ſoft Indifference be approvable by either Party.</p>
               <p>Now how ſharply ſoever they contend in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points, they both accord in this, That it is in no wiſe lawful for Chriſtians either to partake in the Idolatries of the Pagans, which their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion condemns as abominable; or to deſert the Chriſtian Religion, and embrace the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which they account a damnable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, with which no communion ought to be had even ſo much as in appearance; or to joyn themſelves to the Jews, though anciently the
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:119039:278"/> people of God, or partake in any manner what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in their worſhip, for that it would be an abjuration of the name of Chriſt the ſole Saviour &amp; Redeemer of our Souls. And this their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is grounded on texts of their Goſpel ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occurring almoſt in each page, that 'tis ſcarce needful to alledge any example. Certainly, thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> are ſingularly emphatical, <hi>I ſay, that the things which the Gentiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to Devils and not to God; &amp; I would not that ye ſhould have fellowſhip with Devils.</hi> And they are ſo much the more to be conſider'd in that he ſpeaks not to thoſe which were of Pagan belief, for he would not have termed ſuch, Brethren; nor to thoſe which had a deſire to revolt from the Goſpel of Chriſt to Paganiſme; for otherwiſe thoſe words, <hi>You cannot drink the Cup of the Lord and the Cup of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and you cannot partake of the Table of the Lord and of the Table of Devils,</hi> had been wholly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the purpoſe and impertinent; and if he had had to do with ſuch people, he would have written in another ſtyle. But he ſpeaks to ſuch, as either through fear of perſecution or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, were willing to hold in with both ſides, and to retain the Goſpel of Chriſt in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, but otherwiſe to conform, as to outward profeſſion only, to the ceremonies of Idolaters. And the ſame Apoſtle was ſo jealous of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the doctrine which he held forth, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd it ſo neceſſary to ſalvation for the form of it to be retain'd ſincere and complete with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture of ſtrange doctrines, that when certain Teachers went about, not openly to
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:119039:279"/> withdraw his diſciples of Chriſt, but onely to introduce the doctrine of the Old Law in the matter of juſtification into the Covenant of Grace, becauſe theſe are things abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible, he ſays, <hi>Although we or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you, then that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again, If any man preach any other Goſpel unto you then that ye have received, let him be accurſed.</hi> And can it now be conceived he had any favour for this Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? On the contrary, the Croſs was ever the cogniſance of him and others like him, and in general of all true Chriſtians in all Ages; Not onely to denote that they believe in him who was crucifi'd for them by the Jews and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, but that they are reſolv'd, if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, to undergo the like or more grievous puniſhment for the confeſſion of his Name, as not being worthy to have part in his glory, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they generouſly incurre all ſorts of dangers and ſufferings for his ſake. Thus likewiſe he ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever will be his Diſciple, muſt take up his Croſs and follow him.</hi> And the Martyrs of the Primitive Church, who in the infancy of Chriſtianity, ſeal'd his truth with ſo much blood as they couragiouſly loſt, ſo many horrible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they underwent, ſo many ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and exquiſite deaths which they endur'd, have more then authentically confirm'd this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which was ſo univerſal and immutable in them, That he who confeſſes not the Name of Chriſt in the very face of danger, who abſtains for love of him from all religious ceremonies
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:119039:279"/> different from his own, who do's not condemne th m publikely and even in the preſence of Flames and Axes, is faln from the hope of their chief Good and for his unworthineſs adjudged to eternal puniſhment and ignominy; according to that ſaying of their Maſter, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me before men, I will deny him before my Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, for communicating in the Religion of one another, both Parties alike condemne it, and look upon this Indifference as a Profane and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious humor. For they which hold Religion to be conſtituted aſwel by Tradition as by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> alone is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the cuſtody of it, and the Pope the ſupreme mannager and diſpenſer of it, thunder out Anathema's againſt thoſe which are not of their opinion, have perſecuted them with flames and torments, and at this day in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> exerciſe a cruel Inquiſition againſt them of different judgments, though they declare not the ſame; and moreover when occaſion is offer'd they make bloody wars upon thoſe whom they account hereticks. And they believe themſelves bound hereunto by zeal to the Chriſtian Religion and the ſalvation of the ſouls of men, which when they cannot be reduc'd by reaſon, ought to be reclaim'd from error by the terror of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and arms. And as they hold this for a neceſſary courſe towards thoſe who are turn'd aſide from the faith, ſo they wonderfully extoll the courage not onely of the ancient Martyrs, but alſo of thoſe who reſolutely undergo any thing for defenſe of the Roman Religion.

<pb n="530" facs="tcp:119039:280"/> if there be any Country in <hi>Europe,</hi> wherein the contrary Party prevails, they enjoyn their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents to ſubmit rather to all ſorts of evil u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, then to comply with anheretical profeſſion; proclaiming openly that there is no ſalvation out of the communion of their own Church, the head and mother of all others, by communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, participation and dependence on which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, all other Chriſtian Aſſemblies have right to the titles of Chriſtian and Catholick; ſo that whoſo is not gather'd unto it, is out of the way and loſt. On the contrary, ſhould the other Party, who reſtrain all Divine wiſdom revealed for the inſtruction and bringing of men to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within the bounds of the Holy Scripture, approve this pretended lawful Indifference, they would be the moſt ſtupid and inconſiderate branglers in the World: For they alledge this cauſe of their ſeparation from the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, for that they could not with ſafe conſcience partake in its ceremonies; which ha's occaſion'd many great wars, which within this laſt hundred years, have fill'd all <hi>Europe</hi> with deplorable ſlaughters and calamities. Themſelves alſo undergo all ſorts of inconveniences and miſchiefs for their profeſſions ſake, rather then condeſcend in this point to the command of Kings and the bent of whole Nations; they extol the patience of their Martyrs (for with this title they honor the memory of ſuch as have been put to death for defence of the Religion they profeſs) they exhort one another to the like magnanimity, and denounce eternal perdition in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I will not at preſent determine on which ſide the right is. May the Father of Mercy pleaſe to reconcile their minds, and cloſe up this great wound of his Church! But in the mean time, it is beyond all doubt that according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary doctrines they ought to condemn one the other, and hold that whoſo embraces the faith of the One cannot ſecure his ſalvation in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal profeſſion of the Other. For example (for I wil will not engage far in this matter) The Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed charge the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with three accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Of hereſie in its doctrine, in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; of Idolatry in its religious ſervice; and of Tyranny in relation to government, in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry inſtances; So as to call the head of it, <hi>Anti-Chriſt,</hi> and apply to him, as the perſon intended by Prophecies, whatſoever is found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> in the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Revelation.</hi> If theſe accuſations be grounded on truth, how can they comply with that Church, unleſs they will violate this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>A man that is an heretick, after the firſt and ſecond admonition, reject; Knowing that he that is ſuch, is ſubverted and ſinneth, being condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. And how can they but hold the teachers of it for accurſed, according to this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commandment, <hi>Little Children, Keepe your ſelves from Idolatry?</hi> And I cannot imagine that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would permit external communion in the ſame Religion which thoſe whom in regard of their Religion he excludes from hope of the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Be not deceived</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Idolaters ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> And if he forbids <hi>to eat with them,</hi> that is, to converſe
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:119039:281"/> familiarly with them in the way of civil and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary life, much more would he prohibit to entertain ſociety with them in the ſame Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But thoſe words are moſt highly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; <hi>If any man worſhip the beaſt and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, The ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation, and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the holy Angels and in the preſence of the Lambe.</hi> For if the Beaſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd there be Anti-Chriſt, as 'tis manifeſt; and the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> be this Anti-chriſt as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed pretend; and that to receive the mark of the Beaſt in ones forehead or hand, be, as is evident, to adhere to it in external profeſſion, what does he but pronounce ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation againſt himſelf, who believes the <hi>Pope</hi> to be Anti-chriſt, and nevertheleſs eſteems the outward profeſſion of adhering to him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different? For 'tis all one, as if he ſhould affirm it lawful for a good and loyal Subject to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſtandard of the enemy of his King, ſome unjuſt and violent uſurper of his Kingdom. And indeed it cannot be thought but that the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf and his Cardinals, if they believed themſelves ſuch as the adverſary party publiſhes them, would condemn themſelves and all thoſe which follow them.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the Catholicks accuſe their Adverſaries of a temerarious ſeparation from the true Church, and of having added Hereſie to Schiſm, amaſſing their Religion up of all thoſe hereſies which have been condemned by the
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:119039:281"/> ancient Councils; and moreover of having to hereſie added Rebellion againſt the Paſtors, whoſe vocation is onely true and legitimate. Alſo, of having aboliſht the moſt ſacred Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which our Saviour inſtituted, ſubverted all order of Diſcipline from top to bottom; in a word, of having revolted from the faith and obedience of the Supreme Monarch of the Church, the <hi>Vicarius</hi> of our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the ſole and infallible diſpenſer of his myſteries. Now if this accuſation contain as much truth, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeeing it explicated and maintain'd in the writings of thoſe great and even incomparable perſonages which have undertaken the quarrel in favour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in our times, it ſeems to have veriſimilitude, what man ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded can with a good conſcience aſſociate himſelf to people culpable of ſo many heinous crimes; as of Schiſme, hereſie, rebellion, teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſacriledge againſt God, impudence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, and above all of diſobedience to him that repreſents Jeſus Chriſt and God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon earth? Surely he that ſhould in the leaſt connive at or bear with the reproaches caſt upon him might be thought even capable of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting on the perſon of the Redeemer of the World.</p>
               <p>From all this it is eaſily colligible, That this opinion of Indifference of all Religions in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion, is falſe and pernicious; rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers all the exhortations of God himſelf in his Goſpel to ſuffer for the truth, inſignificant; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parages the ſober judgement of the Apoſtles, who were the firſt that propos'd themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:119039:282"/> of inflexible reſolution; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently leads to the contempt of God and of all Religion in the World. For like as one that ſhould profeſs it indifferent to him what man he ownes for his Father, or what Prince's badge he wears inſtead of his King's, would tacitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate himſelf to be of ſome ſpurious or degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate off-ſpring, and that he ha's a venal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſoul; So he that cares not of what God he bears the cogniſance here below, declares ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently that he acknowledges none for his own part, and that his following of any Religion is onely out of intereſt and complacency; and thoſe Pretexts we mentioned in the beginning, how ſpecious ſoever, are onely a coverture to this profane humor. Truth, ſay they, is hard to be diſentangled from the confuſion of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Religions which have the vogue in the world: And God is of his own Nature ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, that he is not ſtrictly inquiſitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, but is better pleas'd with the love of peace and ſociety, then with the adherence to certain particular opinions which occaſions ſuch diſturbances and miſeries. Strange people! who complain of the difficulty of a thing they never enquir'd after, who limit the prerogatives of God and his affections, without underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and who under colour of tenderneſs for peace with men make no conſcience to wage war againſt God, who for the preſervation of Civil Society which onely regulates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the duties of men among themſelves, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and confound the Laws of Religion, in which are contained our duties towards him
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:119039:282"/> who created the World and Men. Certainly, had theſe Opinioniſts imploy'd in the ſearch of God's truth, half the time they beſtow on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable occupations of this life, they would not judge Religion a thing full of ſpinous que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and irreſolvable difficulties. The ſole reading of the Old and New Teſtaments, which would not take up ſo much of their time as a quarter of <hi>Amadis</hi> or the Romance of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> would clear up all thoſe perplexities, and cauſe them to pronounce reſolutely, provided they come to it with attentive minds and free from evil prejudices, for the preeminence of the Faith of Chriſt againſt all the ſuperſtitions of the world. And though ſome knot may be met with here or there by the way, yet what man is there who addicting himſelf to the ſtudy of a ſcience, is deterr'd from it by one or two difficulties he finds in it? How often ha's ſuch a one vex'd his brains for the underſtanding of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and how many days and nights ha's he ſpent in the reading of his writings, diſpairing of being ever able perfectly to underſtand them, who having ſcarce once in his life caſt his Eyes upon the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> complains of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of his ratiocination and the obſcurity of his doctrines? And yet the affair with the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, was perhaps no more then to know whether Demonſtration from the Effect deſerves the title of Demonſtration as well as that which is made from the Cauſe; or whether according to the Peripatetick doctrine Univerſals have a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence out of our Intellect; or what reaſons juſtifie the opinion of ranking Privation among
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:119039:283"/> Principles of things; empty queſtions and of no importance in reference to Life: whereas in the writings of the Apoſtle, the argument is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the glory of God and the ſalvation of our ſouls. But the truth is, where the buſineſs is to render to God the ſervice which we owe him, the moſt even ways ſeem rugged to us; but where 'tis to follow our fancies, all precipices become eaſily ſuperable, and we level moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Had theſe people once underſtood Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and well conceived the idea of it, they would exalt the mercy of God without compariſon more then they do, and withal have a greater dread of his juſtice; and where he ha's reveal'd his celeſtial truths, they would not dare to bring a Lye into competition; where he ha's manifeſted his will, they would not preſume to prefer their own before it; where he ha's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the form of Religion he would have us to follow with his own hand, they would not offer to equal with it either humane imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or inventions of Devils; where he hath ſworn, that As he lives, he will not give his glory to another, and that he will bring ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon his enemies, by drenching his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in their blood, they would not abuſe his mercy to impiety, nor ſleep in ſo profound a ſupinity, but would learn from thoſe who have moſt of all extoll'd his compaſſions, that 'tis a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing to fall into his hands. The great judgements wherewith he hath chaſtis'd all Nations by reaſon of their Idolatries, the dreadful calamities which he brought on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved People for having imitated the ſame, the
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:119039:283"/> unparallel'd deſolation of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the viſible Curſe which purſues that miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Nation every where for having rejected the Goſpel, the breaking to pieces of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire for having perſecuted it, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which lie pours down from time to time upon all thoſe who provoke him, would be ſufficient documents to them that though his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience be marvellous, yet he is terrible in reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging contempt towards himſelf and the truth revealed by him. As for what is alledged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the peace and union of minds inflam'd with ſo great paſſion through the occaſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſome againſt others, and of the tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of States put in combuſtion by differences in ſacred matters; did we ſee no other means to obtain the ſame but thoſe of impiety, it were more eligible to be at perpetual jars and enmities. Did Chriſt, who knew well that he came to bring fire and ſword into the world by the preaching the Goſpel, deſiſt therefore from preaching it, or command his Apoſtles to conform themſelves to all profeſſions according to occaſion, for fear of exciting ſeditions and tumults? No, ſurely. Should the world periſh by combuſtions, his truth muſt be maintained. But by the grace of God we are not reduc'd to thoſe terms. To turbulent and inconſiderate minds Religion is often a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of commotions: to violent and bloody ſouls the ſame Religion is ſometimes an incitement to murders and maſſacres. But wiſe and politick Princes, who give not themſelves up to their own paſſion or to the furious zeal of others, have well underſtood, how, notwithſtanding the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:119039:284"/> of profeſſions, to contain their people within the compaſs of duty towards them and concord together; and experience hath atteſted that when they will employ their prudence and authority therein as they ought they are equally well ſerved by oppoſite Parties. So that the zeal of Religion being moderated by the laws of reaſon and humanity does not ſo tranſport mens minds but that they may live peaceable together under one Government although in contrary profeſſion of Religion. Beſides, the two Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (Civil and Religious) have their rights and their laws diſtinct, and the knowledge of the true God do's not lead to the troubling or ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of humane Commonwealths, no more then ardency we ought to have for his glory ought to render men murderers and barbarians. But what tends all this diſcourſe to? For certainly, theſe people who ſpeak ſo much of the publick peace, have no great care for it; tis their own peace they are ſolicitous of. And becauſe their God is the grandeur, pleaſure and contentment of the world, they hate the profeſſion which croſſes th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir deſigns, and lays obſtacles before them, &amp; which hinders them from mounting whether they aſpire. And being 'tis an infamous thing to be accounted a deſpiſer of the Deity, and they which declare freely that Religion is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be prefer'd before the things of the world, are ordinarily lookt upon as monſters by others, they ſhelter themſelvs under the fair appearence of the deſire of peace, and ſeek maſks to diſguiſe ſo uncomely an aſpect. But he that ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the bottom of their hearts (and they cannot
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:119039:284"/> ſo well hide themſelves but they may be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed croſs their veil) would find there the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God and of his ſervice, which ſhame hinders them from laying open to the world. In Chriſtendom whoever is neither a Catholick nor Reformed, he muſt of neceſſity be an Atheiſt (ſince he cannot be either Pagan or Jew or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan, unleſs he have loſt common ſenſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all guſt of piety) And indeed for the moſt part either their lives or diſcourſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them to be ſuch. For if there be any ſuch perſon that lives in a meaſure honeſtly in the ſight of the world, yet he ſpeaks diſdainfully of Religion, and looks upon all thoſe as beſotted who are lovers of the ſame. Others ſwim in all ſorts of pleaſure, and are ſo abandon'd to diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs, that they cauſe ſhame to mankind and horror to any that conſiders them. Theſe, Truth accounts it a glory to have her enemies. The former ſhe cares for ſo much the leſs as they are much more rare. I pray God reſtore them to a better mind. And to him who hath afforded us the grace to bring this ſmall work to its conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, be honor and glory to all eternity. <hi>Amen.</hi>
